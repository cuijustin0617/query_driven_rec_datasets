Came here for a birthday and got the special where you can eat from the buffet and have the meats too. I liked the variety of foods in the buffet, and the service was pretty good. Our waitress was really nice. I didn't like all of the meats, so if I went back I would recommend just getting buffet access and maybe a smaller portion of meat.Very delicious food. Happy service and very accommodating for our business party. The picanha is mouth watering!Best steakhouse and most reasonable prices in Philly! My Brazilian husband and I go there about once a week to get our fix of authentic Brazilian foodHighly recommended... Friendly service, great food, and clean modern atmosphere. Go on and give this place a try... you won't be disappointed!This place was really great! Meat was tender and sides were decent! I went on a Thursday and there was like 7 different kind of meat. Definitely be back on the weekend to try the whole full menu!Yum. Loved it, went in for dinner with family and friends and everybody loved it. The service was amazing, all of the servers were attentive and friendly and coming from a server, they were A1. The food was yummmmy and the hot sauce was so fiery good! Mix the hot sauce, chimichurri and A1 steak sauce for some banging dippage. We will definitely be back, seriously for the price and the variety of dishes at the buffet\salad bar, why would we even trek down to the city? This is like 5x better than fogo\chima lol. They don't have tooo many varieties of meats, but seriously how many do we really need lol. And they had grilled cinnamon pineapple which was mhmm. We'll be back to try that passion fruit mousse .We love this place! The service is great. The meat is always coming and we never have to wait. There's free parking here and lots of dessert to try too!Great Brazilian food in a buffet style. Everything tasted amazing, I grabbed so much food I could not finish. The rice was amazing, so was the potato salad not from Philly but I would go back just for this restaurant.This place was so good. The steak is amazing. The buffet bar has some great additions. The homemade hot sauce is a must, has some kick. All you can eat for $20 win-win for me.Similar to its local competitors, Taste of Brasil and Picanha. Very clean and staff is friendly and efficient. Hot buffet / salad bar was excellent. We were disappointed with the selection of rodizio, especially at dinner time. Like most of these places, Picanha is offered 4x more often than any other meat. We were offered linguica (excellent), garlic steak (VERY garlicky, but moist and tender) skirt steak (well done and salty, but OK) and brisket (which is as inedible as it is at other rodizios.) No pork, no rib (beef or pork) no chicken, no lamb. I saw another table offered pineapple. I guess we could have asked, but had forgotten.  Certainly worth trying, but for the same money, I believe the other local places offer more variety.Excellent service, excellent food. I was surprised to have found this little diamond in the rough. Didn't know what to expect but it met general expectations of quality and cleanliness. I will come back!Food here was fresh and great, service staff was very friendly and attentive, and the price is reasonable.LOVE THIS PLACE! Such great service and food is delicious. It's like the affordable version of fogo de chao. Skip the valet because parking is available out front!Tried Broncos our for the first time on Valentine's Day and was thoroughly pleased! The staff was great and the food was even better!! I've been to fogo de chao and Chimas and Broncos stacks up perfectly against those restaurants when it comes to food and cuts of meat! I already referred this restaurants to my friends and I will be back soon!This was a fantastic find driving down from Northeast back to Maryland. We wanted steak and we got so much more. All of the meats were cooked to perfection, the sides and fresh vegetables, fruit and salads "to die for". Great juices. Very authentic including decor. Don't let the outside appearances fool you. 
If we are in Philly, we will be back!Quality cuts of meat.  Excellent service!  Leo is usually at the front desk and could not be more accommodating.  Salad bar always changes and has wonderful selections.  They are continually repenishing it and it is obvious that cleanliness is extremely important to this restaurant, as evidenced by the salad bar.  Cheerful atmosphere, good people, excellent food.  Truly fabulous eating!Super tasty food, great service & atmosphere..... Announce if you are new and they will explain the process to you! It's fun and delicious!Came here for the first time and the food option was good. It was less salty than other Brazilian steakhouse I been too, which makes it less flavor in general. I enjoy the choices they have at the bar with the fruits and pasta/rice  and etc. the orange juice tho was fresh but I assume they added sugar and it was $5 a glass. My favorite part about the night dining here was the coffee.Great authentic Brazilian steakhouse.  Service is fantastic.  There are several Brazilian restaurants in the area but this is by far the most consistently good option.  It's become our "go to" when we are looking for a quick but good meal.First time here and like this place already. Staffes are friendly, food is good and the best is BYOBI really like this place. Don't let anyone tell you not to go HAM on the buffet and salad bar. Load it up, and keep the card flipped on green. They'll respect you more. I'll respect you more, for whatever that's worth. It's the kind of place where even when you feel stuffed you don't feel gross. And when I asked for the check our host was like "you sure?" which is the perfect response in an all you can eat establishment.Food was amazing and not bad on price highly recommend. Mango salad was probably my favorite. Along with a slew of beef cuts it's def worth the travel. I live 30 minutes away and it's seriously worth the drive. Coconut flan was amazing tooHere for a friend's birthday party, the food and service here is awesome. Everyone enjoyed the food and environment. Would definitely come back again for casual meals or events.Heard about it from a friend and very glad I tried it. Very pleasant surroundings, delicious fresh food and pleasant staff.  Five of us dined for $60.  Amazing value. Try this restaurant.Very good food - we love the rodizio style restaurants and these guys hit it on all marks.  Great beef, quick service, excellent buffet, and very accommodating wait staff.  We came with the kids and they had a blast!  We will definitely be coming back.Visited 2 weeks ago and still thinking about the food. Amazing, fresh, authentic Brazilian food. The staff is very friendly and I love that it's byob. Their sides dishes at the self serve area are amazing, full of flavor and They have a number of hot dishes which other steakhouse don't offer. They also serve Brazilian coffee when you're done and a grilled pineapple slice which are both delicious. I will be returning to this spot.Beautiful restaurant, great service, delicious food. Probably the best steak house on castor. Will def come back again!I have been here twice already. Once during a weekday and once on a Saturday. There are more different choices on the weekend which makes sense since it is busier and it cost more but Monday-Thursday they have all you can eat special for $20. We still had a good amount of choices on a weekday just no filet. Both times the staff have been exceptional. Definitely very friendly and attentive.Went there for my mom's 70th birthday. The Server was awesome, but the variety was not. The three meats we were served were either undercooked(garlic chicken) or overcooked. The small buffet area was not appealing either. Again, the server made all the difference.Decent food, good service, but a little expensive. Lunch (unlimited meat) with tip approximately $30. Ouch.Was here on a Saturday early afternoon. The service was slow due to one person cooking and serving while others seemed to just stand around.
The food was very-very good and diverse. After a while the service got faster. Would definitely go back.Plenty of sides and the meat and the flavors are exquisite! The cold salads are just ok could be better .Well worth the money in comparison to Fogo de Chão Brazilian Steakhouse, I kinda like this place better , it's more personable , less traffic without the chaos of center city. The manager even came out to spoke with us very nice lady . Go try it out. . My fiancée & I will return soonFood here is so good, for such a good price! I took off one star because the pricing wasn't 100% clear, at least not to me. I didn't know I could go back up for more even if I didn't choose buffet, because I definitely would've! The meats were cooked perfectly! I tried the passion fruit juice they have, not too bad. The sides were ok, I only liked about 1/2 of them, but I could be picky.I think this steakhouse is sent from heaven. The meats are juicy (some overly salty but on par with the other steakhouses), the hot buffet is delicious, and the cold buffet offers some refreshing foods. The flan was to die for. It was exactly like the way my Dominican friend used to make flan. All the workers are Brazilian so you know the recipes are legit. I think my favorite meat was the sausage. It was not salty and tasted homemade or bought from a Portuguese butcher. Everything here is better than the big chain Brazilian steakhouse restaurants. I suggest stopping in and doing the unlimited meat, then getting the flan for dessert. It's a big flan so you will need a few people to eat it.The food here was good. The servers were very helpful. The meat selection was very good tender and flavorful!!! The only issue I had is where the sides did not have a description of what the food was. They should have a sign saying what things are which will make things a little easier and selecting what you want to eat and not guess. But the food was great. I will come again.Very delicious! We went for lunch and the lunch special was $20 (Monday-Thursday) all you can eat! The food was tasty. The staff was pleasant. They ask how our table likes their meat before they even start to serve. Will go back again...and this time check in, so I can get a free Brazilian coffee. Missing one star only because all the buffet items weren't labeled...nor the cheeses.Went to Broncos this past Saturday for dinner.
We made reservations for a group of 12. Place was clean and food was good. It could have been better if the meats came out a bit more quickly and regularly. I had to request certain types of meats several times before it came out. Authentic Brazilian food for a great price. food was good but service was a bit lacking.First chance I am getting to post a review. First off, I wish that I knew that the price for the all you can eat was more on weekends. For those who aren't aware, they charge, $19.99 per person on weekdays and $24.99 on weekends. 
The appetizers are nicely displayed, but most of the food isn't labeled and you end up hoping it will be something you like. That being said, what is there is delicious and they have a lot to choose from. 
My gf and I enjoyed the meats that were served. Wish that they had more of a variety. I enjoyed the fruity beverage that I ordered. Refreshing. 
We will be back some time on a weekday.Our First time in Broncos Brazilian Steakhouse, The place is amazing, food is awesome. They provide all you can eat or by pound, Both are worthy.  The service is superb, Maria Isabel make our lunch a special one. Looking forward to return.Great food and great service! They are BYOB which I love and I've always had great experiences with the staff.How to not love this restaurant? Food is amazing, meat is awesome, customer service is great. I would give 10 stars if I could. Definitely eating there whenever I can!My sister had an event here for her daughter's first birthday! This place is amazing! 
Great staff, great food! Their hot bar and cold bar was delicious so many different varieties of food.Food was incredible, owners and staff are great people and I look forward to going back. The selection of meats is second to none. Very clean and welcoming restaurant. One of the many hidden gems of Northeast Philadelphia!Fast service. Great waiters/waitresses. Attentive to water needs. The food quality is great and tasty even without any sauces. The hot bar is kind of lacking, but that's understandable since its not the main attraction. 2 for $60Great, affordable Brazilian steakhouse. Awesome customer service. Staff is very attentive to diners and will make sure you get a wonderful dining experience here. The meat selections are plenty to pick from if you choose the buffet option. The hot and salad buffet bars are also great with some excellent items. Will recommend this gem in Philly to my fellow traveling friends and definitely be back next time I'll be in town!!!Good food, reasonable price but service is disappointing. Nobody asking if we want something to drink or if we want desert etc.Horribly overcooked, to tough to chew. Side bar was old and stale. You need to know nothing else.I love Broncos! I was so happy to see a Brazilian steakhouse open up nearby. Same quality meats as the center city Brazilian steakhouses, but way less expensive! There's a wide variety of food options at the salad bar and anything I've ever eaten from there was simply delicious. Not to mention the meats....soooooo good! I'd definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for tasty Brazilian food at an affordable price.Loved this place....have been to Fogo De Chao, loked this better!!  More intimate and much better priced.  Steaks were amazing and the mango seafood salad was to die for!!  Highly recommend!I really enjoyed my dinner at Broncos! I'm Brazilian I need to have my barbecue often and the food here taste like home! The steaks were tasty and succulent, and the hot buffet was awesome. Very friendly staff. I can't wait to come back and I would recommend Broncos to anybody who loves a very tasty steak!This place is a bit pricey if you're going there at the wrong times. It seemed like the regulars were taking the option to pay for their meal by weight. All of the food tasted great, especially all the different types of meat they had available. They even brought us out some roasted pineapple at our request.I feel a bit schizophrenic about this place.  The food, every time we've been here is awesome, especially the meats they bring to your table.  The only food complaint I've had, and it's a minor one, is the food temps.  The hot foods can be hotter and the salads colder.  I noticed that the restaurant has been cited for this in a few of their health inspections.  Other than that the food is incredibly good.  
My complaints have to do more with other issues.  My biggest gripe is there are no posted prices.  You don't know from day to day what you will be charged.  Are the prices set day by day?  The servers do a poor job of communicating this information and it's usually not clear what you will be paying until you get your bill.  It doesn't hep that there are several dining options, all priced differently.  I can't help but feel like I'm getting ripped off every time I eat here.  Maybe that's not the intent but without clearly posted prices I just don't know.  My other issue is with the undisciplined children.  Is it a Brazilian thing?  I've noticed the same thing at Picanha Grill.  I understand you can't expect kids to sit at a table perfectly still and quiet but that doesn't mean they should be screaming and running around like at a playground.  Last time we were at Broncos one group had unruly kids break two plates on the tile floor.  It was a wild, out of control group and the restaurant staff did nothing about it.
So while I think they have the best Brazilian food in the area I probably won't be back until the pricing is made clear and they ask their patrons to keep their children under control.Amazing tasting steak  my fist time in a Brazilian Steakhouse. The natural lemonade is to die for!Great food and good service. I must place to eat if you like Brazilian food. 
The staff was friendly and made good recommendations.Loved it here. The staff is SO polite, the ambient is so relaxed & cozy, The meat was great and they had a nice variety! O
Plus it looks and feels clean, that's important too. The pineapple with cinnamon seems to be precious in this place so don't forget to try that if you stop by!
Obrigada Broncos ;)I chose all you can eat with well done meat.
Ribeye - very dry.
Top sirloin- dry but the second and 3rd round of this had more flavor and wasn't as dry.
Brisket- very dry.
Garlic steak - only one we got consistently, good flavor not dry, but very thick to bite through. 
Sausage - actually tasted like coffee most of the time, but was juicy, would get again. 
Roasted pineapple- great taste loved it, has cinnamon all over.
Price was ~ $60 for 2 people. Saladbar was very good for the most part, loved the mango salad. I was full when I left but felt like I missed a bunch  of meat, left unsatisfied but full. Somethings still missing from this place.This was not a bad experience, but the food was not as good as expected especially for the price. We got two all you can eat buffets and cost $75.... way too much.Some consider Broncos to be an economical alternative to classy Philadelphian restaurants like Fogo de Chao or Chima, but I thought it was a completely different, unique experience. Almost every aspect of the meal was of good to exceptional quality.
Firstly, most of the meats were pretty tasty. Some highlights included some very juicy chicken wrapped bacon, ribeye, lamb, and their house special picanha. Some cuts, especially the brisket were rather tough, but this did not overshadow the positive quality of an overwheliming majority of meat selections.
Additionally, the salad bar offered selections such as collards, hearts of palm, beets, and sauces that were all very fresh and tasty. I tasted a strong plum flavor in the chimmichurri which was quite unique from the traditional. The hot bar featured various Brazillian staples, including yuca flour, collards, and a well seasoned black bean pork stew.
Lastly, the service was a bit spotty at times. Various servers came to check up on our party and ask about how our meal was, but water glasses were rarely refilled and there were ~10 minute stretches without any rodizio meats coming out of the kitchen. I guess that a busy father's day can justify the long wait in some aspects. The atmosphere was casual and comfortable.
Overall rating: 8.2/10Didn't know what to expect, but as soon as I walked in on a Saturday early afternoon, I figured it out. This is the first Brazilian restaurant that I went to and immediately heard people speaking Portuguese, with waitresses and a manager who all took pride in the restaurant, the food served, and quality service. You can get the fresh meat all you can eat, or just the buffet all you can eat if you don't want that much meat. Plus they specify which level of cooking you want you meat to be at before they come, which I appreciated! 
At the buffet, there are several fruit and veggies sides and appetizers, as well as a goat stew with yucca, bread with cheeses, rice with mussels, the best hot sauce (homemade with a spicy kick) and much more. 14.99, next time I'd consider just the cold/hot buffet, or you can go by the pound, which is what more people were doing.
But then we got our meats. Short ribs, top sirloin, brisket and more all to taste and fresh, directly to the table until you need a break. The cuts of meat are huge, so specify if you'd like more/less of a certain cut or if you want to split one around the table first. A little salty on the outside, but so lovely and marbled with fat, and it tasted great with the sauces they had. 
Based on the all-out amazing buffet items, as well as the juicy bbq meat, the price is worth it. Ask if you have questions, and if the meat is coming out slowly, make sure they know you're still hungry! We had no problems, expect that we got full and wanted to keep eating.Sooooo goood! Fresh steak! Why got to chima steak house if we have a local Spot with half the price for all you can eat STEAKS!Craving Brazilian all-you-can-eat without going broke?  This is your place ($20 M-Th; $25 F-Su).  Casual storefront in the Rhawnhurst section of the Northeast.  (Best offerings Friday through Sunday; 4 1/2 Stars.)This is a great place to fill up. The food is tasty and plentiful. They keep the place clean and organized. The staff is friendly and makes you feel welcome. The all you can eat is the go to. We come here all of the time and will continue to patronize themSo we decided to try something different and wow so glad we did!  I'm not a big fan of meat, but the salad bar was a win!! So all you meat lovers....GREAT PLACE TO CHECK OIT.  Food and service was on pointWent here for a Christmas-time get-together and it is awesome! Well-priced, family-owned, quality restaurant. The picanha is very good and well-seasoned. Also, the waiters are very attentive and polite. The stars of the show are the people coming around to carve the meat tableside. They aren't stingy with their servings so come hungry!Omg wandered into this place for lunch today and was delighted.  All the meat is ridiculously good and grilled over fire.  You can try a little of each.  Was very pleased by the salad bar and vegetable options.  So fresh and delicious.  Gonna head back here.Good food, but we have a surprise on our check! Don't trust the website! The price are higher! 
There is no menu price for beverages and dessert!Love, love, love. Not only are the people so friendly and helpful but the food is amazingly delicious! We did the all you can eat option and tried everything they offered and everything was amazing. The cheesy rolls and the salads in the buffet were delicious along with the meat being perfectly cooked! I had the mango fruit drink at our waitresses suggestion and it was delicious, I would go just for that!This place is a carnivores dream! The wait staff is very polite and friendly and the restaurant is very clean. The salad bar is just right for something before you start the meat onslaught of brisket, tenderloin, sausage, roast beef and all done to your liking. It's a small restaurant not like the other Goliaths not as many cuts of meat but done right none the less. Definitely a another visit is in the future.Went to this wonderful establishment on 3/24/18 for dinner. This is authentic as it gets!!! There are no fancy set ups just authentic delicious food. The staff from the cashier to the waiter to the passadores were friendly and accommodating. The food was delicious, there is a hot and cold food area (salad bar) as well as the unlimited meat. The hot and cold food area is traditional Brazilian food, you will not find mashed potatoes and other americanized dishes like at the chain brazilian steak houses. The meat selection included bacon wrapped chicken, brisket, sirloin, ribs, sausages (pork), lamb, and rib eye. All the cuts of meat were good. At he end of your dining experience you get some cinnamon roasted pineapple which they say helps for digestion (it tastes like apple pie). Overall i feel this place is worth the money you spend and the food is very good. I would recommend this place to a friend for sure.Wow!   We randomly found this place on Yelp today and wandered in.  So delicious. Happy to find that it was in casual restaurant and my friends and I had a great time. The all you can eat is a really great deal and the steak just keeps coming. Highly recommended. The wait staff is an absolute delight. What are you waiting for? Go to this place and eat all the meat. You just can't beat their meat.We got there at 8pm . Service was good in the beginning but at 9 me and my friend were the only people there and they decided to stop coming with meat. And stop refilling water at 8:40pm. (They closed at 10)The taste was alright but nothing special. Not much variety in meat compared to other places.
As to the decor, they spent a lot of money on the salad bar area. But the tables and chairs themselves are cheap and uncomfortable. 
Because of the taste, the service, and the fact they decided to stop serving meat when they felt like it made my friend and I very uncomfortable. We felt like we had to leave. Pretty disappointed. I have now tried all of the steakhouses in the northeast and I still have to go back to my original one which is picanha...I honestly tried with these new steakhouses but Broncos is another disappointing one.I went there for my birthday.We did get there late like 9:10 pm,so it would close at 10:00 pm.Still had food out on cold/hot bar.Some of the dishes were looking 
like they been out a while because tops of food were  looking hardened.So got to the table and guy comes with meats.Plenty of that coming.I tell the waitress  I would like another drink.She brings me a coke soda can and my cup has melted down ice in it though.She didn't notice because was in rush to clean up and get everybody cleared out of there.So when I get home I get bad diarrhea and feel like I'm gone to vomit.I got sick here from bad food,no doubt about that.Was gone to be my favorite restaurant,now it won't be.Oh by the way my boyfriend got sick too.What a good birthday dinner,,not coming here again.Have to say wow.  We discovered Bronco's only after we had made a reservation elsewhere and discovered it was still over an hour wait with the reservation.  Drove 20 minutes and our party of 5 was seated right away at 730 on. Saturday night. The staff was friendly.  The restaurant clean and rye food was very good.   A great new find and a place we will return to soon.Incredible food! 
Must try this place, good for families and dates! I went in with a party of 11 and had a reservation. The staff was friendly and helpful in suggesting what meats were tasty and the best to try. The waiters walked around with huge slabs of meat that we could cut off and the steaks were so flavorful and tasty. They also had a salad bar with all types of salads, potato, cole slaw, more meat, chicken and fish. 
This place is also BYOB which is always a plus. We went during restaurant week and got all the food for such a low price. The food was literally so much that I felt like I couldn't move after I was done eating. I thank God I was wearing stretchy pants because I know my stomach was expanding. This is a type of place, I wont feel guilty eating like a beast because the food is cooked to perfection and its all prepared fresh and you can tell it wasnt just sitting around for long hours. 
The dessert is a lso a must have, I had the chocolate cake! and it was so MOIST! My family had the flan, chocolate flan and some type of custard. Everyone was happy with the restaurant my sister picked and we all walked out needing to maybe hit the gym every day the rest of the week, due to how much food we consumed.My favorite steak house in Philadelphia. I personally think it's better than other places like Fogo or Chima. & If it's not better then it is definitely in the conversation for being one of the best in the city. The food here is almost too good for real life. All choice cuts cooked to perfection. A little light on options for dessert but I'm usually too full to worry about that by the end of my meal. 10 out of 10 for their food & service. All the servers are happy, helpful and very attentive. I've never had a bad experience! Just make sure you express how you want your food cooked to ensure you have the best experience & the flavor you desire from your meats being placed on your plate!Wasn't super impressed. I felt there wasn't enough choices of meats. I thought the meat was either  chewy or dried out. Service was poorOut group of 5 went here for the first time last night! 
Theres ample parking in front of the restaurant & we were sat down immediately! The waitress was very nice & tended to our needs at all times! The salad bar was amazing and had so much variety! The rice and black beans were my favorite! Along with the bread with cheese inside & the shrimp Alfredo. So delicious.
The reason we gave 4 stars was because some of the meats we were served were a little dry & over cooked! Other than that everything was super good!Food was really good and they servers were really nice and fast as well...steak was coming out fast and I really enjoyed the mango salad and garlic steak was delicious. I liked everything about this place and I will definitely b back soonDecent food, good service, but a little expensive. Lunch (unlimited meat) with tip approximately $30.
