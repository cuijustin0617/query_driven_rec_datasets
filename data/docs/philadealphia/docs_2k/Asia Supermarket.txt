This place is great!
I don't know why people are complaining about the state of the floors or the selection of toothbrushes. That isn't really why you'd come here.
They carry a great selection of Chinese veggies, spices, frozen goods, and canned/jarred items that you won't find elsewhere. I've always found the staff to be friendly and helpful.When I tell my friends that I usually go to an underground supermarket, it does sound shadyy... 
But I promise, it's worth a visit! The variety of Asian grocery items is nice and very decent for the price. But sure, it's far from a fancy place. Though it's not like you're really hanging out there anyway. I get my groceries and leave.This place is overwhelming.  I mean I went to get an Electric Tea Kettle for cheap and I didn't leave disappointed.  When I went to get some food for dinner, I was like WTF?  Things are all over the place and a lot of it appears to be past its sell-by date.  I went with my mother once and she thought it was cool--which I guess is something.  The asian supermarket across the way on Race between 10th and 11th is cleaner and better organized.i have found everything that I need here my japanese and chinese soups, stocks, stirfries, and salads.  I will say that the staff is not particular helpful, so you should be prepared for some trial and error.  For example, there were 25gm bags of Bonito fish flakes next to 100gm bags of something that looked similar but had no English writing. I asked an employee (I think) and he said they were the same.  The price was 3 dollars for the 25gm or 5 for the 100gm.  However, it turns out that the 100gm bag was not exactly bonito flakes, they were some smoked variation.  It didn't necessarily taste bad, just wasn't what I was expecting, and would have been nice for someone to identify that.  I also know that saying "no" or "i don't know" is not accepted in some cultures, or by some people.  the three stars is because I have found staff at other stores more helpful (or honest?), but the selection and quality make up for it.
I haven't tried any of the fresh or frozen seafood but if I do I will update this post.If you're cooking an asian meal, chances are high that you will find all your ingredients here for a solid price. I don't know why people are so creeped out by the fact that this place is underground. It's Chinatown. It's no Trader Joe's, and the first time you walk in you might feel strange about walking down to a basement, but I always feel safe in there. All around, you can get most of your shopping done here, from your grains and noodles to your veggies and meats. I recommend King's market if your shopping for fruit or seafood.Definitely an experience.  Once you get past the smell and the dinginess and the fact that you're underground, you can find some fun and interesting foods.  You can also get produce much cheaper than in other grocery stores.  Their selection of frozen dumplings is impressive, as is their array of herbal medicines.If I would go, I'd like to go some where that's closer to home, nothing special about this place. I bought an expired canned fish here .I don't know why everyone is hard on Asia Supermarket. Yes, it's dirty, and yes it's underground so it can smell, um, "exotic." But that's kind of par for the course with Chinese grocery stores. The prices are good, the produce is (mostly) good, and the selection is by far the best in Philly's Chinatown. If you want a specific type of soy sauce or chili sauce or bok choy, this is the place to get it.Asia Supermarket is what it is. It's dark, damp, a little dirty but at it's core it's a condiment paradise. Now to be clear most "gringo" shoppers won't have any use for or a complete understanding of what the condiments are but if you're ever reading a recipe and that one weird Asian ingredient pops up that you never heard of it's most likely found here.
They have fantastic prices on shirataki noodles and sriracha, a lot of really cool chili and peanut oils,  and a wide variety of Thai sauce mixes. I got miso mix for some wings I made over the Superbowl that were out of this world. 
The biggest issues I've found with AS is that the employees have been less that helpful. Perhaps it's a cultural thing but while gathering ingredients for a homemade bahn mi I had to ask for some help and was hastily and a bit rudely passed around until I eventually gave up. I wasn't going here for the service though, if I want conversation I'll go to Trader Joes. 
All in all this is a solid place and even though boo refuses to go here I find myself venturing down the dark stairs into the unknown from time to time just to look around.This underground supermarket is filled with the Chinese food that is probably slightly cheaper than the Chung May around the corner, but is less well organized. There's a lot of aisles here and a lot of different products, although sometimes I find expired items on the shelves - just point it out to a worker there.  A semi-decent fresh produce section, but I prefer to go here for various canned goods and snacks. 
Garage above will be validated with $10 of purchases, I think.
A small food court in the back for noodles or vegetables.Whenever I need anything Asian from kimchi to dried noodles, I come here. The store is relatively clean. However, you need to check the expiration dates on the dried goods as some of the less popular items tend to stay on the shelf too long. 
One of the downsides is the parking. It's a TINY parking lot and you can easily get stuck waiting behind several cars. And when it gets really bad they'll sometimes open the lot for a school across the street.This supermarket has a pretty good selection of Asian groceries (predominantly Chinese but also some Indonesian, Vietnamese, Japanese, and Korean flavors) as well as kitchenware. The prices are reasonable and the checkout is quick. I do wish some of the produce was fresher but overall it's a great one-stop shop if you're planning to make an Asian meal.Garage validates but purchases of rice or noodles don't count??
And I saw a mouse running though here. Looks like I'll rely more on Chung Mei across the street and other places from now on for anything that isn't canned/glass-contained.This place is alright..... This is my H-mart alternative since  their grocery store is outside the city in the ghetto somewhere. However, it is also the most expensive place in chinatown for groceries.
*********CAUTION**********
Make absolutely sure to bring a calculator with you because I have caught them over 4 times charging me for things I did not have in my grocery bags. They usually have a habit of adding an additional 20% of costs. THEY DO NOT HAVE A SCANNER, they input your grocery costs manually, so beware.
The people usually doing this are the high school girls who work there part-time on the weekends and the lady on the cash register that is closest to the indoor restaurant. 
********CAUTION*************
I have only been here about 10 times. I have only just started double checking what they charged me. They probably do this every time I go in.
Although half white and filipino and actually live in C-Town, I suspect they target anyone who look like tourists or aren't Chinese...... 
Now I know why my friends always triple check their receipts around here.
You have been warned.I guess since I've been to the huge Asian markets in the 'burbs I wasn't impressed by this market (despite hearing people fawning on about it). It's cool for what it is and that its convenience to Chinatown and Reading Terminal Market area, but for me they don't have enough variety of certain ingredients I go to Asian market for, for example panko or hoisin and/or hot sauces. 
So...if you're in this area anyway this is definitely worth a stop, but I wouldn't go out of my way to go here like I would for the big stores.It seems I got trapped in the negative reviews bashing up this place for the faul smell (typical of many Asian grocery stores), and wasted my time and money for a long time to go all the way to Washington Ave, when everything that I need is possessed by Asia Superstore.
Agreed, I am Indian, so won't know the exact needs of a hardcore Chinese/Asian cook, but I do cook a decent variety of "vegatarian" Chinese/Asian food, so I think this is still a quite good store.
They even have the specific Korean chili powder that is a MUST if you are a fan of Sundubu Jjigae (soft tofu stew). It's the same one used for making kimchi as well! Also their prices for fresh produce like Boy Choy, Napa Cabbage, and others are dirt cheap (in my opinion) compared to their American counterparts.
The typical size Tofu packet that costs you $3 or up at an American grocery store is for $0.98 here! Sure it is not "USDA Organic" or "Non-GMO project"certified, but the package does say "non GM" soybeans... and since it's produced in the US, I am inclined to their word for it! :PThis is truly a hidden gem in Chinatown.   There are so many products available.  You can buy a wok or bamboo steamer, and in the next aisle, you can buy green tea or asian noodles.  Best to come with a list, because its easy to get overwhelmed as there is so much to choose from.  
My favorite items are Temple of Heaven Green Tea, Tofu Shirataki noodles, Srirachi asian hot sauce and sesame oil.  There is even a large produce and seafood section.  Everything you need to prepare your favorite asian dishes is all here, plus the prices are pretty cheap too.  
If you get tired and hungry from shopping you can also stop in the little restaurant located in the supermarket.  They have great noodle dishes that are very tasty and inexpensive....plus you can leave your shopping cart within sight, just outside the restaurant, while you eat.Asia Supermarket.
Expect an Asian supermarket. The aisles are fairly maintained, things kept in stock. However, expect dust on the home products, and potentially expired foods. The important thing when encountering establishments by Asian immigrants, is to expect the right level of service and quality. Service, low to none, and quality, medium to low. However, selection and price? Yes sir! 
The only redeeming quality for this supermarket, is that I can find my childhood candies, oriental bowls, and awesome staples of Chinese culture, that I cannot seem to find anywhere else, strangely enough. I haven't been looking hard, but Asia Supermarket fulfills all my needs.
I wouldn't buy groceries here. Don't trust the quality. Well, it is Chinatown... It's cheap, but you get what you pay for.
Also, Tasty Place is located here.This market is really close to Market East, has a wide variety of dried goods, and opens later than most of the other grocery stores nearby. But the frozen and fresh selections are somewhat paltry... Chung May has 2/3 the space and twice the cabinets! It's also a bit more expensive. I would go here again, but really only if it was after 8 PM.This is another Asian supermarket that's a great source for basic foods with a long shelf life, like dry noodles, cans and jars, of which they have a pretty good selection.  I especially appreciate their selection of coconut milk.  The produce doesn't always look so great, but some is fine.  As usual, you need to check carefully before you buy.  They also stock a lot of kitchen supplies, so that's handy.
Reasonable prices in general.  There's a credit/debit card minimum ($10, I think).For an asian grocier this place has a lot.  Although if you don't speak Chineese the chances of finding anything your looking for are slim to none.  
The produce section is a disapointment with most things wilted or rotting.  The poultry is cheap and apears to be cut in the store.  They have "fresh" fish and a meat counter.  They also have a restaurant inside the store.  Most of the isles are disorganized and several items can be found at different locations in the store.  
If your looking for something specific and are in the area you may want to check this place out.  
If your looking for a proper Asian Market check out some of your options on Washington Ave in South Philly.The only store I've ever been to where the entrance is a stairwell leading to a basement full of fishy smells and a large assortment of everything. Green tea, jasmine tea, pu-erh tea, chrysanthemum tea... flat noodles, rice noodles, ramen noodles... frozen dumplings, kamaboko, candies, mochi (quality not worth it), produce that doesn't look fresh (but not bad), and a meat counter with chops, grounds, pork belly, and seafood items. The aisles are small, so opt for the basket if you aren't getting a lot. This used to be my go-to Chinatown store, but after that new grocery store next to Tea-Do opened, it makes this place look real dismal. Best to check out all the other stores in Chinatown, in terms of value and quality, before hitting it off with this place.Love the underground restaurant... Cheap n tasty don't mind with not tidy nor not too clean at all...This supermarket is at the basement level. Not as complete as the big Asian supermarket. Lack of varieties of baked buns. However I like the Chinese medicine section near the register.I want to buy this place and turn it into an underground club. 
But for a supermarket, it is not bad. There is even a butchershop and fresh groceries (fruits and vegetables) for sale down there. Although I'm minus-ing points for uncleanliness and being disorganized.I am begrudgingly a fan. I don't want to like this place, but I damn near have no choice.
There's nothing you can't find here. 
If you're making a fusion dish, this place is your best bet. They have regular American mayo and ketchup; both are surprisingly hard to find at other Asian grocery stores. 
If you're making a tradition dish, you'll find everything from specific kinds of dried fish, noodles, and even specific cooking utensils. 
Their prices are mostly comparable with other Asian markets, though I have found pricing discrepancies in some instances with Asia being the overpriced party.
The useful stuff aside, they have an astonishingly extensive collection of snacks. I have definitely come here and spent more on candies and cookies than proper food on a few occasions. 
My main grudge with Asia is that it's underground. I think being underground has intensified the weird smells present in the store. It definitely feels, looks, and smells like a basement. It's not exactly a pleasant shopping experience. I suppose that's forgivable considering most Asian markets are no thrill.  
If there was a store identical in selection above ground I would never set foot in Asia again. Even so, it doesn't feel right to give an unfavorable review because of the inferior location.This place is a decent place for groceries, when compared to many of the inner-city asian grocery stores that I have visited in the past. It has a lot of your basic groceries, from fresh foods (veggies, fruit, seafood, meat) to packaged goods (dried noodles, sauces/pastes, snacks). Although its selection is nowhere close to that of a standalone asian grocery store like Hmart, some of its prices on select dried/nonperishable items are actually lower than some other grocery stores. It is also slightly bigger than some of the other nearby grocery stores in Philadelphia's Chinatown. If I was living in the area, I would be very happy to have this grocery store in the vicinity for my asian grocery needs!
I would normally rate this as 3 stars due to its small selection of products as compared to non-inner city grocery stores, but it gains an extra star for stocking water spinach (a DELICIOUS veggie that is not available at many grocery stores in many regions across the US)! 
They also have cute mini shopping carts, which would be very fun for families with kids.I have to agree with previous reviews. Asia Supermarket is downstairs, and there are two enterances, you cant get there if you're handicapped. this place has fresh fish, clams, lobsters, etc, but the cages are dirty and need cleaning. they have fruits and vegetables and so forth. rice cookers, pots, pans, chopsticks, bowls, brooms, a lot of things you could imagine. the bathroom at this supermarket is totally filthy, with no lock on the door. there also is a small viet restaurant in the corner that sells food. it has a large traditional medicine section. i tried it once, so-so. most of the cashiers speak only chinese or vietnamese.A kid in a candy store...that's how I'd describe my first visit.  And while the reviews provided an accurate description of the physical description of this market...it's the contents that matter...this gem is truly a SUPERmarket. 
I've come to rely on H-Mart for my Pacific Island cooking needs but I was downtown so I thought I'd stop in here for a few things that I forgot to get earlier in the week...I ended up spending an hour in this store and walked out with 3 heavy bags before I realized that I was on the el and my car was at home. 
They have absolutely everything I need other than pancit noodles...I was pleasantly surprised to find my beloved prawn crackers that I hadn't seen since I visited Japantown in San Fran.  Not only have they stuffed quite an assortment into this dingy basement, but the prices are great...bye-bye H-Mart, hello Asia Supermarket. 
As Elva L. said 'there's nothing you can't find here."Descend into the dark, dimly lit depths of Asia Supermarket, and you will find one of the largest grocery stores in Chinatown.  Walk down either of the two concrete steps entrances, and you will find an underground lair of grocery shopping adventures and misadventures.
ADVANTAGES (to other grocery stores in Chinatown):
   -  Nice selection of pots, pans, cookware
   -  Meat and poultry is cheap (though others may say not the best quality... I have found no problem with regular skinless chicken breast for $2.98 per pound)
   -  Large selection of oils, sauces, marinades, and pre-packaged noodles 
DISADVANTAGES (to other grocery stores in Chinatown):
   -  Poor selection of frozen foods (dim sum steamed buns, dumplings, etc.)
   -  Darker, dingier with an ever present basement smell
   -  Produce always looks worn and tired
   -  Many items are not labeled at all, or are only labeled in Chinese
   -  Dishes, bowls, plates are incredibly overpriced like most of Chinatown
   -  Do they rotate the stock?  Me thinks not!  Some items are covered in dust
I don't do all of my grocery shopping at Asia Supermarket, but I do routinely visit it in a series of stops for food in Chinatown.  It is good for some items... and deficient in others.
If you're a tourist, I'd suggest stopping in to just wander around or to be confused.  If you're just grocery shopping, be a smart shopper.  Some prices are cheaper than nearby options, and some prices are more expensive.
And whatever you do, don't be fooled into buying the cooked sliced frozen snail meat because it's only $3.  Yuck!  Snail is fine... but this... this is rubber city.DUMPLINGS! and Pocky! and Shin Ramyeon! and MORE DUMPLINGS!
Whenever I'm around 12th and Market I have a huge dilemma: do I want to go to Iovine's for fresh produce and crowds? Or do I want to walk a few more blocks for the dingy creepy underground awesomeness that is Asia Supermarket? Decisions, decisions.
Whenever my Asian half gets the best of me, I never regret it. Aisles full of soy sauce and sesame oil and chili oil and sriracha and every kind of sauce you could ever imagine. Rows and rows of noodles-rice noodles, vermicelli, ramen, every kind of noodle ever! I think they even have white people noodles. Freezers full of DUMPLINGS- veggie and pork, veggie, chicken and veggie, chicken and pork? They have all of them.
The veggie section and meat section can be tricky though, because everything's labelled in Chinese...so I hope you know what the vegetables you want look like.
Cheap prices, great selection of Asian goodies, and they take credit card over $10 I think. Don't be scared to go underground. And Tasty Place (the "restaurant" inside) is pretty good too (and super cheap). You're welcome, world.I used to think it was weird that this store is underground, but nowadays, it's my go-to Asian store in Chinatown.  They carry a lot of the stuff I usually need to cook with.  They have pork belly, whole chickens, preserved eggs, Chinese sausage, coconut milk, coffee, sugarcane juice, all purpose flour, eggs, cilantro, oranges, dried and sorta fresh noodles, candy, Asian pots and pans, etc.  The stuff I just listed are things I have had to run in last minute to get - they are supposed to close at 10 PM, I think, but they like to start closing up around 9:30, so if you're needing something that late, I'd hussle or else you might find yourself stuck without said Asian ingredient.
The store is a little dirty, and kinda creepy (because it's underground), but hey, it's convenient for me, especially since they are open later than the surrounding Asian stores.I am very happy I found this place. I can now find all my Chinese foods and snacks here. I come here from Wilmington every other week or so to get my Chinese grocery. This place has a lot of selections and prices are good. If you shop here and park at the parking structure, 1st hr is free.Ok, here is an update...I still love this place in spite of what I've witnessed my last few visits.  I've been disappointed, mainly with the cleanliness of the store.  The ceiling was dripping and parts of the ceiling had fallen into the aisle.  I let it slide the first time, thinking that it would be fixed the next time I visit, but I've been back twice since then and the ceiling is still not fixed..and the last time I was there, there was a ladder in the middle of the aisle...of course no one was on it working to fix the ceiling.  There was still ceiling pieces on the aisle floor too.  This place really needs to get it's act together and clean up or I may have to find a new place to buy my asian groceries!   Nothing worse than shopping and having something drip on your head.Definitely not the best Asian supermarket I've been to, as it's really dirty, really dark and it smells, but there's something alluring about this place.
Perhaps the first thing is that it's located on Race St. in Chinatown, right past Pho 75 and Joy Tsin Lau. It has an in-house restaurant upstairs and the supermarket resides downstairs. When I say downstairs, I mean underground downstairs.
The second thing is what I mentioned above: it's an underground supermarket. To me, that's kind of cool and it's an interesting way to use a space. However, if you're getting a truckload of groceries, climbing those stairs isn't going to be a joyride.
The prices are normal for an Asian supermarket for the majority of their goods, so it's a good place to stop by to pick up some snacks and drinks if you plan on hanging around the city for the day.
What's nice is that they do take credit alongside cash, but you have to make a minimum purchase of $10, which isn't all that cool if you only want a box of Pocky or Koala's March and are a dollar short.
I try to avoid the meat and seafood sections as they smell really bad. Normally when I go to Asian supermarkets, I always get smacked with that distinct pungent smell of various meat parts, but here it's just way too strong. Thankfully, for special meats and such we can't get at regular supermarkets, my family and I go to other stores in the city or in Cherry Hill because they're cleaner and less smelly. Also, they're fresher with their selection.
I wouldn't recommend anyone to go here for large, I-need-food-in-my-apartment shopping, but I would send people here to see what an underground supermarket looks like.This place is disgusting.  Over the summer I got a big bag of rice, and its was infested with bugs.  I went in there last week to pick up some wasabi and pickled ginger, and I saw a rat run by (not a mouse, a rat).  I went running out shortly after.  
The only upside is the selection of dishes, pots, pans, etc.  I have a steamer and a tea set from here, and I enjoy them both.Woah I found tea packets taking large dust bunny clouds ! Seriously,It must of sat there before I was born. Some of the meat was so so but it didn't get any better. I saw meat with the worst freezer burn in my life. That "meat" must of been in the back of the freezer for months and they finally decide to let it out to defrost . 
Honestly you have to know what your looking for espically on how dim the area is: bring your glasses homie! Cause its darrrrkkk. and you BETTER look on the date when the product might expire because it's self life is properly way over due.This Asia Supermarket is great, no matter what you are looking for from soy products to veggies to and outstanding selection of teas, they got it. I go there often and love it and would recommend it for any Asian ingredient for your meals or just to stock up on Asian cooking supplies! You can also buy in bulk especially rice and save more money. There oils and cooking sake and wines are interesting and they offer a wide selection of those. I recently bought oyster sauce there and it was cheaper than it would have been in my local supermarket. The place is a bit dingy but just look past that and you will see the pearl it is!Over the years, this basement emporium has become my last resort for ingredients that just can't be found anywhere else in the City.  That special vinegar for dumplings, the fried chili in oil with black beans, and the narrow gauge rolling pin for making dumpling skins from scratch, all reside in Asia Supermarket.  But, you might need help finding all of them from the amazing employees who have the entire layout memorized.  
Speaking Mandarin or Cantonese helps, but with a smile and small kowtow, they switch to English and will even guide you to where these treasures are found.according to the definition of what a supermarket is: "a large self-service store selling foods and household goods"
Asia Supermarket does encompass Asian foods and chinaware...however, I would not say it has a wide variety of other household goods. You would mainly go here for key ingredients that you need to cook certain Asian foods. 
I noticed that they don't have quality brands of toothbrush, toothpaste, or feminine napkins. If you're really desperate to have any of these items, you'll find them but the supermarket only sells crappy kinds... I asked one of grocery clerks if they had tampons or pads and she didn't understand me. I had to show her a picture on my phone. I was so desperate...
When I was checking out, I noticed that she owed me two pennies...I was going to say, "it's OK, I don't need change", but even before I offered--she just assumed and closed the cash register. I know it's only two pennies, but i was kinda taken back. I left feeling yucky overall. I think I'm going to continue to shop at Hmart even for Asian products from now on.While I wouldn't wager on the last time the Department of Licenses and Inspections walked down the stairs into Asia Supermarket, I might take your bet that we could find a completely esoteric noodle sauce, cookie, or tea previously believed to be extinct anywhere outside of China.  This place seems to have all that stuff, and more. The prices are cheap, the aisles narrow, and the shopping carts from a bygone era.  
Still, if it is something you remember eating back home, or a cooking utensil unavailable in Sears, this is the place you may find it.  Go for that reason, or for the great sense of nostalgia emanating from every shelf and refrigeration unit.  
It is not every day that you can be both a consumer and an anthropologist at the same moment.  The museum-like quality of some of the dark corners makes this a multi-dimensional experience. Stock up on your packaged, canned and bottled goods at good prices as you explore its inner recesses. 
Don't forget to come up for air.This place is only for those in the know.  And, I wish I wasn't one of them.  It was tucked away through a small shop.   You go down about twenty stairs into a basement grocery store.    There were live frogs, turtles, crabs and various fish.   None of which looked in too good of a shape.  There were flies buzzing around and the meat case was disgusting.    The store was virtually empty.   There was a small cafe to the right of the bottom of the stairs.   Two individuals were eating.    There were lots of bins filled with Chinese candy, spices and household goods.um, it's not really that clean at all, and the selection isn't fabulous. the asian supermarkets in south philly stock a hell of a lot more. but it's definitely convenient for people living in center city! 
but the point of this review was: why the heck would you pay $5 a pound for baby bok choy at a white-person-farmer's-market when you can get it a dollar a pound here?!!?Great supermarket. Stuff is cheap, but some might be cheaper in other stores. Lots to explore. Live seafood, fresh meat.I was fairly unimpressed by this market. I came here hunting out some specific spicy sauces for a few dishes I have recently had a hankering for, and I was freaked out to find myself to be the only customer on a fairly busy summer day in Chinatown. Things seemed to be fairly average in price, which was surprising because I find most Asian markets to have goods at a steal. Probably need to kick it up a few notches on the cleanliness scale as well..not exactly "appetizing" in here.A funny thing happened while shopping... After enjoying dim sum in Chinatown, we took our adventurous American friend to this Asian grocery store in the basement... as he bounded down the stairs into a murky, poorly lit atmosphere, the sights and scents of the protein section were augmented and concentrated by the underground, claustrophobic location and lack of powerful (or really any) ventilation.  Once he laid his eyes on the living, hopping, crawling, and non-living exotic proteins found in such an emporium, our friend promptly turned a bit green and made his way back up the stairs - rather more slowly and less steady than he made his brave descent into this lair.
We, however, enjoyed giggling at our friends discomfort and picked up the Asian ingredients we needed.  Job done, we headed home, and everyone (including our good friend) had a nice chuckle.They closes today after being in business for 3 decades. It has emotionally supported me being an immigrant.
It reminds me a little taste of home. I love about how I can find exotic items that otherwise wouldn't find in other supermarkets.
The pricing's very affordable as well, so it became of my reason to even go to Chinatown, is to get some groceries.
Even up till the last day, they gave us a generous 50% off all items closing sale.It might look like a slum but you can find some cool stuff there! It's my favorite place to buy authentic Chinese soy milk and Japanese candies!
There's a wild selection of tea too,the price there's reasonable considering they got most of the stuff shipped from all over Asia.I really like Asian supermarkets and I don't often find major variation in them. They have hard-to-find supplies at good prices and have a fishy smell. This one is near my weekly grocery commute, so I want happy to use it. Plus, it's connected to Tasty Place which I love!My go-to place for anything Asian and grocery related. And to be clear, it's actually underground: you can go through either their 11th St or Race St entrances. Yes, as other reviewers mentioned, it's not the most appealing supermarket to look at. However, this has no effect on their produce's selection or freshness. Their vegetables are always crisp and healthy-looking.
Other pros includes their frozen sections and their snacks. They have over 20 varieties of frozen dumplings and just about any type of frozen delight to satisfy any type of craving. Their snacks section is also quite impressive, with selections from around Asia, including Japan and Vietnam.
They also sell kitchenware, although I can't really comment on its selection or quality. Definitely a place to stop by if you're in the neighborhood and have a craving for something. It's also a great place to stop by if you're looking for hot pot ingredients. Not only do they have your common frozen fish balls and soup base selection, they sell pre-sliced meats that are cut perfectly for hot pot. And they're at prices which are more than reasonable.Supermarket located in the basement below the parking garage. I think you get free 1 hour parking at the garage if you spend like $80 at the supermarket (don't quote me on the price but I know there's a minimum for free 1 hour parking). 
I come here for my some fruits and vegetables. Fruits aren't always fresh but usually fine for the basic apples and bananas. Not a fancy market but you'll find your Asian snacks and grocery needs. 
Staff is nice and helpful. 
There is an elevator if you need to bring a cart up with your groceries. 
There's also a restaurant towards the back of the supermarket. They're not together but it's definitely somewhere good to try out too.I've definitely visited better places on the West Coast.  That being said, this place does have your basic Asian market needs.  It's located in Chinatown, tucked away inside a building so it's a little hard to find.  I think you have to go through some doors and down some steps to find it, but once inside, it's really easy to navigate.  The layout is a little awkward but I think it's more due to the lack of space and the larger size of inventory.  The prices weren't too cheap nor was it expensive - sort of in a gray zone.  I personally feel that one of the benefits of shopping at an Asian market are the cheap prices, but I wasn't really impressed with the prices here.  Plus, it wasn't brightly lit and was a little dingy.  
Apparently, this is my brother's favorite Asian market in the area. I am curious what others are out there and will have to explore a little more on a later date.  Good enough, but nothing spectacular.My personal go-to for my weekly groceries here in Philly Chinatown for the following items:
-Meats (chicken thigh/drumsticks, ground pork, spare ribs, Taiwanese Chinese sausage)
-Dumplings ($5/bag), Scallion pancakes, Cha-siew bao's (Hong Kong style are my favorite)
-Vegetables (Chinese broccoli/kale, bok-choy) are my go-to's - already packaged and typically about $3.50 per bag ($1-2/lb) - veges are already pre-bagged
-Cilantro - $0.99
-Chinese flavorings such as: Soy Sauce, Rice wine vinegar, Oyster sauce, tapioca pearls, green beans, red beans, noodles, brown sugar, mochi, condensed milk, coconut milk
-They also have Hot Pot materials and other things like tiny bowls, basic household items, etc.
Tips/Takeaways:
-Quiet gem for your weekly grocery needs
-I would probably go to Sprouts for fish
-I'd go to Heng Fa for buying Rice, but noodle pricing here is the same as anywhere else
-Lines are short here
-$10 min for credit cardOther reviewers are right in describing it as dark and dirty.  It's like shopping in a dungeon.  I hurried to get what I needed and get out because it was not the kind of place I'd like to spend time in.
I would think twice before buying fresh produce or meat here, but the canned goods I got were fine according to the expiration date, although they were dusty.  At first I couldn't find any prices listed on the shelf, but then I realized there were price stickers on the items.  
When I got to the counter, they didn't even have a scanner!  The cashier had to type the prices in. There were holes in the conveyor belt you put the groceries on. Surprisingly, they take credit cards though.  The cashier was very unfriendly and so was the lady bagging the groceries.  
On a positive note, The coconut milk I bought here tasted fine.  The market is very conveniently located near Market East Station.  I would go here again to get a couple packaged ingredients only if I didn't have time to take a car somewhere better, such as Oregon Market in South Philly.  However, I'd like to avoid it if possible.Welcome to the dingy underbelly of the grocery store world. If you're looking for cheap food with hilariously vague cooking directions ("cook until done") then you've come to the right place. Customer service is basically nonexistent and floor repairs are an afterthought. This place has two saving graces:
1. The groceries are cheap. I cannot emphasize how cheap the stuff is. Sure, some of it is of atrocious quality (stay the hell away from the pickled ginger from Thailand), but you'll feed an army for the cost of one meal at Village Whiskey.
2. They carry strange and rare spices and sauces that you may want to try. From Thai to Japanese to Chinese cooking, they have a little bit of everything. Sure, the clerk will not be helpful at all when you try to find something, but you'll track it down after you wander around for long enough.This underground market has been here forever. Every time I'm there, I feel like spelunking. It's not as big as the markets in South Philly, but it's convenient for Chinatown residents/visitors.
They stock a selection of produce and fresh fish. There's also tea and plateware if you need any. Prices are generally good - nothing's needlessly marked up. Management uses the space effectively, that's for sure.
Hungry? There's a restaurant in-house if you don't feel like leaving.This market located in the basement of a parking garage offers everything you might need. Their meats are a little questionable, but check out their dumpling selection. I was able to finally find the Way Fong dumplings that I have been searching for the last 4 years.Don't judge a store by its odor. Sure, the Asia Supermarket smells a little "not so fresh" and yeah, it's dimly lit... but that's all part of the allure... like that giant flower that smells like rotting meat. 
I can't speak to the quality of the produce or meat since I've never bought them but this is a great place to go for non-perishables, condiments, candy and kitchen gadgets/utensils. Why pay out the nose for a wok or a spider at some fancy-pants store when you can get the same thing for half the price here?
It's a little disorganized but if you like to cook, especially Asian, it's worth the visiting.
