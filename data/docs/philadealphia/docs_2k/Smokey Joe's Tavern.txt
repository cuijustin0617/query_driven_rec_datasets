Average Food. Waitresses were nice, but this restaurant was severely understaffed. Waited 1 hour for the Chicken Hogie.I've been here several times for lunch. I've only been here for the food, so I can't comment on the bar. The interior is somewhat dimly lit and consists of the bar, some tables, and a bunch of booths on the side. Flat screen TV's are displayed on the walls.
I've had both a turkey melt and a reuben here. The turkey melt was pretty dang tasty. I've actually ordered it several times since I first went here. The reuben was just average. The corned beef they used tasted like it was package meat, though it wasn't bad.The salads here are of decent size and the vegetables are always fresh and crisp. The soups are average.
Service has always been good. It's sometimes hard to find good service at a place on a university campus, but this place consistently delivers good service. The waitress who looks like a 2010 version of Farrah Fawcett/Laurie from the 70's show(well at least her hair) is always very prompt and friendly.
When I have time for lunch, I'll be back. 
Just as note, they have $1 hot dogs, $2 drafts, and $6 pitchers Mon-Sat in their "Dog Day Afternoon" special.Smokey Joe, you are getting four glorious stars from me for the sole reason that I am no longer an undergrad, and acting as we did during Erin express would be frowned upon in most other establishments.  Illegal in some states.
That being said....we had a great time.  After waiting in the rain for close to 45 minutes I was really hoping for drunk leprechauns running around in the bar. They fell short in that category, but the beer was cheap, the music was good, and I did not feel old or creepy in the slightest!  As an added benefit, to help alleviate the wait, they had someone walking the line selling canned beverages.  That is what I call customer service.  
Erin Express '11 is already in the worksThis place is spacious and the crowd is great. Drinks are affordable and pretty good. Unfortunately, the music is absolutely horrible. Sounds like they use a Kids Bop CD. We are in our twenties - we want rap and hip-hop not old pop hits. Give the people what they want! (A new DJ!!)Smokes defines UPenn's bar scene (hate it or love it). There are always a ton of undergrads and alumns around Wed-Sat. Each of those nights usually has a special, with Wed having 50cent drinks + $5 cover. 
Inside, the place feels a bit dive, as it is a college bar. There's always either live music or a dj spinning. However, this place doesn't get started until after 1am, which is incidentally 1 hour before it closes (ahhh....pennsylvania's liquor laws). 
Whenever you're here, you always feel as though everyone knows each other, from the bartenders to the kids getting drunk in the back. The reason is: everyone actually does.OK, so JUST to set the context as to why I'm giving it 5 stars...this is "as good as it gets" for those looking to relive (or experience) the glory days of  undergraduate boozehounding and grindy fratparty dancing.
Being in my mid-30s, a grad student with a full time career, and back on a University campus as a student for the first time in many years...I was feeling a little nostalgic for that "je ne se quois" of undergrad life (perhaps a kegstand? Century club? Bid day parties?). 
Thus, upon entering the open-windowed wood threshold of Smokey Joe's (summoned via blackberry messenger  from several of my fellow classmates) I was instantly transported to 1994. Especially when a sweaty 21(ish) year old in a wife beater and backwards cap tried to sidle up to me in the beat of the music (though a one star personal experience for me, fabulously authentic to the gestalt of Smokey Joe's).
Our large group of "elders" (us 30-somethings brought up the average age of SJ's to about 23) was pleasantly surprised to discover the Wednesday night drink specials. Having spent ten years paying LA/SF cocktail prices - up to $15 a pop - I was floored by the 50 cent drinks (!) and $2 pitchers. We began buying rounds for strangers, simply for the pleasure of slapping down CHANGE to pay for a drink....
The DJ played mediocre music, had sloppy transitions, and was probably free - but again, totally consistent with the SJ vibe. 
Capping off the true nature of What Is Smokey Joe's...The TVs were all tuned to the 2009 International Best Damn Hooters Pageant. The contestants were from a random hodgepodge of categories (eg, one would be "Miss Missouri" and the next would be "Miss Sunshine Rodeo Tush" or "Miss Bakersfield Beauty") and their measurements shone onscreen for all to see.
Don't think I'll go back to SJ's anytime soon...but we did have a blast, and for a one-time "relive your early undergraduate experience"...it was priceless.This is the first bar I ever got drunk in. Oh Smoke's, you have no idea what you started.
If you aren't a Penn undergrad, this is probably not the place for you.Penn Bar or not  it's been here since God was a boy. The thing that has changed  is the  attitude of the people that go here. . campus bar in a urban setting .Back in the day when people were more respectful this bar was fun. After last night this bar will not have to worry about me darkening their door.Here's why? 1) Who runs out of food at 930p?( no hamburgers? Excuse me ?)   2) Bar needs to be better stocked.(no Devil's Cut ?)  Our waitress was friendly enough  and did her job to cover for the lack of food items. apologized  for the lack there of. 3) Older bartender needs to get a personality as many times as  I've never seen him smile or make small talk with his customers.4)  Music too loud between sets of Quizzo ( which is why we were there ) 5) The French fries would have been better  if they were not so salty. 7) bus boy too in a hurry to clear a table 8) Quizzo did not start on time. If this suppose to be a college bar they need to go back to school and learn how to service their customers no matter who they I don't think you have to worry about us coming back here.Smokes IS Penn's unofficial undergrad bar. Coming here in the latter part of the evening during the academic year, you'll find plenty of Penn undergrads, the occasional alum who happens to be in town, the alcohol flowing freely and the latest club anthems playing loudly.
It's not a particularly fancy place. The restrooms are below average; the floors get a bit sticky, but the bartenders are always nice, and it's a place loved by Penn students because Smokes tends to serve as that final location to a night out because you know all your friends will be there for that final nightcap.
That's why we go to Smokes.
On a side note, as a local neighborhood pub, afternoon pints and your typical pub fare are pretty good...an underrated aspect of this establishment.Back in the day this was the hot spot in the college scene.. great music & people back in the day.
Still a great spot all these years later!If you are not a Penn student, STAY AWAY from here on a Friday/Saturday night after 11:30pm....
Pros: Cheap drinks, friendly/cute bartenders (I think I accidentally started flirting with one of the female bartenders, and I am straight haha!), good music and atmosphere and in a convenient location
Cons: Honestly, the only con to this bar is when every Penn student simultaneously shows up here. Do all the kegs at the house parties get kicked at the same time? One kid walked over to the table we were sitting at, laid his jacket on our table, stared at us and walked away. Who do you think we are, coat check? Then while trying to get a drink at the bar, the d-bag students kept cutting in front of me. My friends and I eventually left because we could no longer stand how rude and self-centered they were acting. Oh and the DJ wasn't that great...he played songs I liked but in the 3 hours I was there I think he replayed 4 different pop songs.
I will definitely come back, but now I know when it is time to leave!Packed and loud dive bar. $3 drafts. Burgers, fries, and pizza.Great bar when its quiet, god awful when the entirity of UPenn stumbles into it at 11 on a Friday or Saturday night.
One of the staff Joe (not the owner), is one of the greatest bartenders I have ever met.  Always friendly and as a group, we struck up a real rapport.  He treated us well and vice versa.
The beers limited but cheap and the food was ok, if not spectacular.  Bathrooms could have done with a spruce up, they were fairly rank.Yes, my experiences here have been extensive, and I'd be a rich man if I could get back all the money I have spent here, but would be poorer for not having had all those wonderful times I spent at "Smokes."  Not wanting to date myself, but I can't help but remembering Paul, Mary and Bobby here.
Fortunately, the history of the Ryan family still lives on.  This is a basic tavern.  Nothing more, nothing less.  Burgers and stuff, and beer.  Don't come here looking for a stuffed Veal Chop of the latest craft distillery Bourbon. but expect it to be crowded with people having fun.Packed with students during events and weekends, Smokes is not a good place if you have ladies that want to just sit down and have a conversation. I remember during Feb club.. terrible.
This place used to smell a lot like smokes... literally. Fortunately those days are over, but it still has a lingering smell.
It's an okay dive bar, and a place you can definitely mingle with the undergrads. Quizzo on certain days is fun, too. A local place to chat with friends and have a beer or two. One extra star for being cheap (although mixed drinks aren't always strong).One of the best places for happy hour been going there for almost 20 years. Nice Tv's can catch a good game from time to time.Don't come here if you don't go to Penn. You will hate your life. If you do go to Penn, however, it is a really fun place to hang out because you will typically see everyone you know or haven't seen in forever. It's basically like a frat party without the free alcohol and a little less sticky. The bar tenders are usually pretty nice and the drink prices are cheaper than most other bars. It has been THE Penn bar to go to since forever so it's kind of nice to have something like that.
On Tuesdays Kweder sings, Wednesdays they have Sink or Swim where you pay a $5 cover and get 50 cent drinks the whole night (Thursdays during the summer), and on Thursdays they have quizzo at 10pm which is usually pretty fun to go to. The pizza is actually pretty decent but I have not tried any of their other food.Ahhh Smokey Joe's. A nice dive bar situated in university city right off of Penn's campus. I always walk past never noticeing it was there. One day after class of all thing a group of friends and I decided to grab a beer. The one thing you notice when walking in there is slot of Penn history all of the walls, practically everywhere. Not being a Penn student I don't really care. Each time I have gone it was early, so no crazy stories. Their food isn't bad, for bar food it's actully top notch compared to other places I have been. I plan to come back and see what trouble I can get into at night.Ok bar if it's not filled with corny upenn students. I don't mind a crowd but those students are lame. On the plus side there isn't a lot of fights or problems that occur at other bars at this place.I try to give places and people a lot of grace, and so I have never given a poor review before.  However, my experience at Smokey Joe's completely warrants one.  
For starters, I ordered a Root Beer because the waitress told me the sell it.  They don't.  I instead ordered a Diet Coke that tasted like sugar water and so I sent it back.  The manager told us that he knew there was a problem with the soda, but gave it to me anyway and then charged me for it.
We ordered an appetizer and two entrees.  The entrees came out first.  I had specifically checked to make sure that mine did not come with tomatoes.  I was assured that they didn't.  My wrap came out filled with tomatoes.  When our appetizer came, it was the exact opposite of what we ordered: fried shrimp pot stickers instead of steamed beef.  When we finally got the right app, it was cold after about a minute.
They were very apologetic, but again, they still charged me for my drink.  They lumped all three of the items together on the bill, so I don't know if they took anything off, but it was still over $20 for three of the cheaper items on the menu.
I will never go back there even though I live within walking distance.  I had heard that this place had a good reputation, but apparently I heard wrong.I am giving Smoke's 4 stars because I'm a Penn student. If you're not a college student, I would probably stay away from here - it is the college bar on Penn's campus. Unless you are looking for some great pizza during the day - the pizza here is actually really good. They just started serving it this year.
But otherwise, Smoke's is your average college dive bar - kind of like a frat party that you have to pay for. There's nothing wrong with that, but if that's not what you're looking for, don't come here. I've also done quizzo there which is fun, and we won a bar tab for the night. The Wednesday night (Thursday nights during the summer) "Sink or Swim" is great too - you pay a small cover and then get 50 cent drinks for the rest of the night.This bar is next to a bookstore. I enjoy the bar more than the bookstore. Do I enjoy drinking more than reading? The spin of the head buzz more than the collected tranquility after a bright morning of contemplation? Base physical stimulation over personal edification?
Then again, is it so simple as that? Is this not a false dichotomy? Is not the academic as much an addict as the alcoholic, addicted to the high of each insight, his or her thoughts rushing forward with each turn of the page instead of the steady dulling heaviness of the drink? Is the endorphin rush accompanying an original thought for a scholar any different from that which accompanies the drag of a cigarette for a construction worker? 
The words start to spin as I finish my last beer of the night. I pay and leave, and can still feel the bar as I collide with my bed, alone and cold. 
Who was Joe? Did he smoke? Did he feel the same endorphin rush as me? Smokers and readers, are we any different? I do not know. But I do know that we are all anonymous. We are all just an anonymous "Joe".Always a joy. The menu is basic, the ambiance is divey. But what do you expect? Its my favorite spot and it's been good to so many people for so many years.This is the iconic Penn student bar. I started hanging out at Smokey's even in high school as a student in Philly, but it was in the old building  on 38th with carved-up tables and booths and it was really almost like an old speakeasy. Sadly, it moved when I was in grad school almost a decade later and though it tried to retain the flavor, it's now trying to regain the atmosphere of 38th & Walnut Streets from the early days by a wood panel front, and the carved tables are sort of there, but the menu is also pale shadow of the past. Burgers and pizza. No "Texas Tommy", which was the crack of a classmate of mine (hotdog stuffed with cheese, wrapped in bacon and deep-fried. I never could bring myself to try one, even as a skinny, underfed grad student.) 
This is the quintessential college scene bar, overcrowded, and the place to be. But I miss the old days. Ya had ta be there.Went for Quizzo on Thursday, called three times in advance to check that it was scheduled. Showed up early with a few other teams, asked again and confirmed the time and place. After 2 hours of watching the Quizzo dude prance around the bar and stop the music several times, we finally guessed that it wouldn't begin. 
Only giving a two because the other servers were nice and the beer was cold.If your a Sr @ Penn n not in a frat, then this IS ur frat. The drinks r pretty cheap. the space is pretty cramped. its def hot. theres a dj (tho im pretty sure he might as well use an ipod). the floor is sticky. n come last call theyll play those 2 TERR songs to get u the fudge out. oh memories.Amazing fries and wings. Omg the pizza so good. The place gets poppin at night too. Slow service though.Sink- or Swim.  I think I floated kindof sideways.  The problem with Smokey Joe's is space, and they run out of it really, really fast during the weekdays.  We went there about 10:00 and were one of two groups there.  Suddenly, almost without noticing it, there must have been 180 people crammed sweaty body to sweaty body out on the dance floor.  It became impossible to take advantage of the cheap-ass well drinks (50c apiece after a $5 cover).  And the temperature inside the bar had to rise to 90 sticky-floor degrees by midnight.
That being said., the DJ was solid, nothing that creative or shocking.  It was "pop-song dance hit after pop-song dance hit" like some infomercial CD compilation.  Which means it was great for dancing, which I suppose is the purpose after all.
IF you go there earlier in the evening, you can drink a lot for cheap and enjoy a pretty nice dive bar.  IF you go there after 11:30, may God be with you.Love this place. It's a packed college bar during the school year and a chill drink spot during the summer, but anytime of year the bartenders and service are great. Don't know them all, but Paulie, Joe, and Alex have made this my go to spot since I moved in to university city.
Also a huge fan of the Sunday night open mic. Chris who runs it is super talented, and game to play anything from Adele to Pink Floyd.
Anyway, if you're local this is one of the best places to be. Hope you like it as much as I do!I've been in here a couple times for lunch and never had a bad experince. Server was very friendly, food was good. I've never been here at night but for a relaxing lunch to sit and read and not be bothered it's always been good.An empty bar on a Sunday night is great for me, as I was able to commander to two TVs to show the Angels-Red Sox Game 3 playoff game. Yeungling was also 2.50, so I was a happy camper.
Good service, but then again the place was empty..but still I liked hanging out there to catch a game. I hope to catch Game 4 there.Situated at the west end of campus, Smokey Joe's, or Smoke's, as it's known among students, is the University of Pennsylvania's version of a college bar. For a lot of Penn students, Smoke's is the ideal place to meet up with friends from across campus after a late dinner downtown or a house party on Delancey Street. Pitchers and mixed drinks are much more reasonably priced there than at the bars in Old City, and, with a great location and a long campus history, Smoke's is the one place where juniors and seniors at Penn are guaranteed to run into friends and classmates. From midnight to close on weekends, the place is packed to capacity -- I'm assuming, perhaps generously, that no fire codes are ever broken -- but outsiders, take heed, as many of the student-patrons can seem clicky and, err, standoffish, and you might be left thinking, Damn, why did I come to this uncomfortably-packed bar just to be alone with the people I came with? And DJ STYKX, well, he does his job, playing the radio hits and college bar anthems you'd expect. But again, don't expect to meet any terribly outgoing folks on the dance floor.  
On weekdays, Smoke's can be a relaxing place to go with a couple of guys (or gals) to watch the hockey game, snack on some decent bar food and down a pitcher. Monday nights feature a singer/guitarist, Kenn Kweder, who has been hanging around campus for about thirty years -- and, actually, he doesn't sound bad. At 9:30 on Thursday night, contestants form teams and compete in a locally-developed trivia game called Quizzo. And they drink.
On it's website, Smoke's calls itself "the Pennstitution." Which is true. It's also one of the liveliest college bars in Philly proper. But as an alum of the West Philadelphia Ivy, I'll tell you this: a Penn bar nothing like a Penn State bar. Good things happen at Smoke's, but not crazy things. Well, not that crazy.As a former Penn kid (ehem), I frequented this place back in the mid- to late-90's.  Check that.  I spent the better part of 1996 and 1997 in this place, including a streak of 38 consecutive days (don't judge).  I recently went back (during the day) as part of a quick jaunt through West Philly (don't ask) and found it largely the same as I left it so long ago.  That is:
- Lots of bar area, which never stopped it from being impossible to get a drink unless you knew Joe, Joe, or one of the other less career-minded bartenders.
- Disgusting bathrooms, which was nearly irrelevant back in the day because everyone pees outside on their way home.
- Sticky floors, which usually get cleaned up, but I guess I showed up on a day after some serious drinking occurred.
- Great specials, including the always popular "sink or swim" Wednesday nights and "kill the keg", wherein the purchaser of the last beer from a designated keg gets yet more beer.
- And finally, many, many drunken students doing many, many shots and behaving very poorly.  
Great spot.As a Penn Alumni, was disappointed that the hours of operation as interpreted through Yelp was not accurate. Wanted to take the family there for lunch this past Sunday, but while shown as open at 11:30 AM, in fact the kitchen wasn't open until 5:00 PM, just the bar. So much for celebrating fond memories.A staple for any Penn student. Quizzo, Sink or Swim and Penn artists trying to make an extra buck to pay for more beers. They offer an all-you-can-eat pasta night, because, well, they truly understand college students.
Be warned: these are the smallest, smelliest bathrooms north of the Schuylkill .I give Smoke's 5 stars for one reason.
Kenn Kweder.
Yes.  I love this man.
Really.  But not in a sick, stalker, psycho kinda way.
Anyhow I spent many a late night in the early nineties watching Kenn and drinking watered down gin & tonics and eating greasy chicken wings.  Back then you could even SMOKE inside Smokes.
Ah the good old days.
Jammed with Penn Kids - but the nostalgia factor runs high for me here.Def. not my cup of tea..and I def don't understand how anybody could go to this place on a regular basis. The drinks were good but the music sucked..I hadn't heard the macarena since 97 til I walked in there and everyone looked the same. All the girls had brown hair and brown eyes and dressed the same and all the guys were in button up polo's tucked into khaki shorts. Does anyone have a mind of their own?? It was just a place where all the kids whose parents pay their way through school and have an AMEX card go..Back in the 70s, when my dad was in undergrad at the University of Pennsylvania, he would come to Smokes (what everyone calls the place) to kill a few brain cells. Thirty years later, my best friend goes to UPenn, and whenever I visit we go here. It's definitely a place to end your night (at least, before you hit up a late night food place). You can sit in a booth and talk over a few pitchers, or dance your cute little butt off. Their bathroom situation is a little dismal considering how crowded it can get, but between Kweeder, Quizzo, and just seeing lots of friends,  this place is just as fun for my father's daughter as it was thirty years ago.By it's nice wood interior and lengthy bar, if you were to see Smokey Joe's empty, you'd presume something higher of its nightlife. In actuality, this is the B or C-team bar for UPenn's campus, as it's right across the street from campus.
As Jon aptly pointed out, this is a college bar - and unlike neighboring New Deck or Mad Mex, it can't even "sort of" disguise that fact. It's crowded, it takes a while to get drinks, and you'll always see a double dose of that pretentiousness that reinvents the scene "library caaard" scene from Good Will Hunting.
The last time I went here, I left, went to Allegro, bought beer to go, and kicked it in the park. Smokey Joe's gets no burn.For a dive is is great. I'm not sure why people are expecting the food to be made by Gordon Ramsey. 
It's bar food. I've never had great bar food. 
Smokys lets you bring your own food though! 
This is great because you can get anything from around the area and have a nice drink. 
There is a bartender here that is a goddess. She is like 6' tall pretty and thick. The girls in this area of of a better grade being that it's on a prestigious college campus. 
I used to come here for every Eagles game. Unlike most bars they let you adjust the volume on the TVs. I love that. 
The drinks are CHEAP. My friends and I are Temple grads but we never drink at the Draught Horse because the prices are ridiculous. 
There is one bone I have to pick here: they turn a blind nose to people Smoking in the downstairs section. I hate cigarettes.
They also have live bands weekly, open mic nights and Quizzo.This bar, affectionately termed Smoke's, is a hit with the UPenn crowd, though when I went, I wasn't wowed. The place is usually packed on the weekends, with hundreds of drunken students wandering around, weaving in and out of the dance floor.
You know the songs that you hear repeated on Q102, over and over and over again? It seems that Smoke's soundtrack consists of those same played out songs. Yes they are popular but a little variety would be good. 
There is ample room to dance, so if, like me, you are more of a dancer than a drinker, you still can enjoy yourself. There is even a little podium, oddly similar to those at strip clubs, where drunken girls can gyrate their hearts out and be ogled by equally drunken guys. 
Though Smoke's is not my flavor, if you go with a bunch of friends, you are sure to have fun.Their new kitchen is great. Get the cauliflower hoagie. You can't go wrong. I hear the chicken cutlet hoagie and the tomato pie is amazing too. Somehow I can't get away from this place.Being new to Philly, and just out of college, I wanted to find a good bar to relax after work and throw back a few sips.
I went with my roommate and I immediately noticed a lacking tap bar.  Guinness, Coors, Blue Moon, Yueingling(sp), the typical stuff.  I thought at first they would have more choices since the place kinda feels like a bar with a good selection, but further came to notice that the row of taps on the far end of the bar was a mimic of the same selections.  Kinda dissapointing.  
We sit down and order a beer.  Comes out great, no problems... gaze over the menu and its typical bar food.  Quickly finish the first round and set our empty glasses down.  Mind you this place was by no means packed...the bar had maybe 15 people total in the place that were all taken care of, but it took about 5 minutes for him to refill (read: ask to refill) our drinks.  Maybe I'm spoiled, but the bartenders i'm used to, when they see an empty glass, their first priority is to refill it.  This bartender was just snacking on his hot dog and walking around whiping the bar off... and i did notice him look at our glasses a few times.
Finally I give him the "2" sign of a refill.  We ordered Blue Moon for our first round, and it was assumed we would get Blue Moon for our second.  I noticed him filling 2 new glasses, and since we were the only 2-person group in the bar, I again assumed they were for us.  Well he starts tapping Coors into it, so I think he may be filling it for someone else.
The first glass is placed in front of my roommate full of Coors, and my glass is half full (he set it down to wait for the head to settle)... I mention to him that its not Blue Moon, and he quickly checks it and refills it...No problem. 
The real issue now arises.  He takes my half glass of Coors and fills it the rest of the way with Blue Moon, which automatically turns the beer from looking like Coors to Blue Moon, but of course does not come close to taste since they are two completely different beers.  
Anyway, I mentioned it to him and he took care of it (since i think he really did know what he was doing).  We didnt order any food, and our bill came out and it was 4.50 per pint.  Again, maybe I'm spoiled, but i dont think there are many pints in this world worthy of $4.50.... 
So we left a 20 and went home...But still, good atmosphere, great convo's with the other patrons (all were very welcoming since we mentioned we just moved here), and seems like a good bar.  The service may need to step it up a notch, but for now, this visit gets a puny 2 stars.
Also, I didnt see any of the college crowd (summer, 7-8:30 pm), but a lot of people (not college kids) started to come in by the time we were leaving, so we might have missed the crowd on this one.I enjoy Smokes for Happy Hour. Its quiet - I can hear my friends in conversation! And the beer is cheap and I enjoy the dollar dogs.
I will never step foot in here past 9pm though - the over-packed dance floor and people spilling drinks on me is just not my scene!!I've never been to this place for drinks and never plan on it.  However, it certainly sufficed for a quick cheap lunch when I was driven through the doors by sudden rain and lack of umbrella.
This place actually had decent bar food and I was excited to see not only green, but red and banana peppers on my chicken cheese steak.  You can expect other deep fried items from deep inside their freezer.  
This is definitely not a destination kind of place.This was the final bar on our Gator Guzzle pub crawl. We had made the long slog of consumption and we were going to put the nails in the coffin at smokes. Like the other bars on the crawl, this place was empty at 7pm on Saturday. We took over the place.
I don't think it's true, but the bartender was joking with us that he takes the empty bottles of Tanqueray or Bacardi and fills them with bankers club. It was kinda funny, and might be true. True or not true, it doesn't matter; they were selling us $2 pints and $6 pitchers.What's not to love about this place!  Great food, great service, great drink and beer list, in a great location!  My group of six enjoyed it all. The pizza, mussels, and meatballs were all delicious.  We will be back!Went on a Wednesday night and it was more quiet (which I sometimes prefer) and I loved it! The bartender is a really great guy, good conversationalist. Overall awesome bar and really affordable.Drink spec ails that aint so special. Maximum douchitude. No thanks.I'm only reviewing this based on visiting multiple times on weekend nights.
My first question is, how is Smokes not closed down for fire code violations?! On the weekends this place is literally wall to wall people. If there is ever any emergency a huge stampede is going to cause some serious injuries. This is a HUGE mark down for the place and I look forward to the day my friends have moved away from Penn so there is no reason to come here again.
If you don't mind being crammed in like a sardine, then this is a pretty good place.
The drinks are very reasonably priced, the cover is only 1 dollar and the music selection is pretty good.I ate here nearly a decade ago and had a terrible experience, so I've steered clear ever since. Today I decided to give it another try.
There's really nothing special going on here. It's a corner bar on a college campus, so I assume it's a perfectly good place to hang out and drink, but I don't recommend it for food unless you're prepared for the absolute most basic bar food.
The menu consists almost solely of pizzas or burgers. I ordered a burger, the "beef and bun" one that allows you to build your own. I got it with onion, lettuce and pickle, plus cheese and bacon. I also added an extra patty since they are only 1/4 pound.
The burger and the fries that it came with were absolutely average, which is fine. The garlic knots I ordered as an appetizer were fairly good, but they were brought out with my meal rather than before.
They don't have unsweetened iced tea which only further my thinking that this is more of a bar that serves some food than an actual restaurant.
The waitress was attentive and kind enough, though I did notice that I was charged 75 cents for the lettuce/onion/pickle that the menu says are free. I pointed it out to her on my way out and basically said "It's not a big deal to me, but I'm leaving $20 for the entire meal either way, so getting that fixed will affect your tip."
I don't think I'll be in a rush to go back any time in the next 10 years.My ol' standby College bar for 6 years here in University City.  Glad to walk back in after an absence of - 15 years (yikes) - and find it's still  goin on.  Classic Ivy League bar/pub.  Brass, wood paneling, murals, memorabilia, sports stuff. Memories: leave totally wasted, sweat-drenched after dancing for hours, and driving the wrong way down Market Street to the dorms. So, the wall-to-wall weekend/late night crowd - smile to my face.  Enjoy.Smokes is a mixed bag.  If you come early with a group, grab a table, and relax with some conversation and some beers, it's a good time.  The staff is pretty friendly.  That being said, on weekends and Wednesdays, you have to be in the right mindset going in, as the place becomes packed to the point of not being able to move and hot as hell.  Dog Days, Quizzo, and Kweeder are highlights but I've had better times at other local bars and places downtown.  It's kind of a dive, but in the end Smokes is still the place to see and be seen on campus and usually is the place a Penn student ends their Saturday night.DO NOT GO HERE AFTER 8PM. REPEAT...NEVER AFTER 8PM.
I'm not a penn student and I'm not a loud obnoxious drunk, therefore, I do not frequent smokes after 8pm since those types take over the place.
I like thier $1 hot dogs before 6 and the $6 pitchers until 6. It's really laid back in the afternoons and the bartenders are always nice. I like the chef, he is really funny and comes out to make sure our food is good.In case somebody hasn't said it already, this is a Penn bar.  For a while (before they added Tap Houe to the mix) this was THE bar on campus, the pinnacle achievement that the younger students dreamed about and ultimate bragging rights if you used your sister's ID and could actually get past the bouncers when you were under 21.  
That being said, this bar is horrible.  I mean just don't go here unless you go to Penn.  Even if you do go to Penn, don't go here.  From Thursday to Sunday it's wall-to-wall students with serious entitlement issues, sweating on your clothes, stepping on your toes, and knocking into your beers.  You can sometimes get cheap drinks, but the bartenders are butt-holes with even worse entitlement issues, and act like it physically kills them to serve you drinks.
Senior year a bunch of my friends went here for lunch, kind of as a joke but also kind of because we wanted to try the food, and we had hands down the MOST awkward meal of all time.
We were one of two parties in the restaurant, and the waitress got our order wrong and handed me a plate that was intended for the other table.  It was close enough to what I ordered so I started to eat it, THEN the waitress came running back in tears asking me if I had ordered that dish.  With a mouth full of breading and grease I blurted out some kind of consent that sounded like "mgjjddm hmmm".  Our poor waitress ran back to the kitchen and all I could hear was this crazy shouting match that sounded something like: 
"YOU F***KING IDIOT HOW COULD YOU F**KING BE SO STUPID.  THERE'S TWO F**KING TABLES. YOU F**KING WHORE IDIOT BITCH, I NEVER WANT TO SEE YOUR F**KNG STUPID FACE IN THIS PLACE AGAIN" 
And she was crying and trying to defend herself and everybody could hear the whole thing and it was horrible.This place now serves one of the best pizzas in Philly. They used to have the standard, greasy pub food one expects of a divey college bar. The atmosphere is still the same (like Blarney Stone and Drinkers West), but the food is now awesome. The menu is short and sweet and the prices are totally reasonable ($15 for a very generous pizza with basic toppings). The crust is the winner here, and the tomato sauce is bright and fresh. If you prefer a style of pizza like Allegros or Powelton Pizza, theirs might not suit your taste. If you like the pizza at Dock Street and/or Pizza Brain, Smokey Joe's new kitchen will treat you right.stiff drinks.  and cheap.  not my scene, but it'll do.  we're not in nyc anymore, kids.The best food around. The chefs and guys who run the kitchen make amazing food at very inexpensive prices.Fun for some Penn nostalgia, but otherwise not so great unless you are still in school.  I got here around 10 on a Friday night with a bunch of Penn alums.  We enjoyed ourselves at first, but once we started getting shoved around by a ton of college students around 11, it was time to go.  A lot of the same bartenders are still there which is cool.  Would probably enjoy going back for a Kweder night.Came to Smokey Joe's recently with a large group (25 ppl) of out-of-town family and friends. It was perfect!
I worked with Paul ahead of time to prepare for a large group. We were able to let him know the time and party size with no stress about accommodating us and no pressure to do a specific or prix fixe menu. When we arrived, the tables were all set up and the servers were ready to take our order. Great and friendly service!
There were a lot of different people in our group and everyone loved it: 20s loved the divey feel, parents loved the throwback music, guys loved being able to watch sports during the meal. Something for everyone! 
Also, Enjay's Pizza was great. Made the food quickly and everyone could find something they liked. 
Can't recommend it highly enough!Smokey Joes has been a Penn institution since 1933. The current incarnation shares the space and perhaps tables from my college days here.
The current owners appear to be pizza folks. The pizza is very good. 
The atmosphere was disturbingly quiet which saddens me.Really liked the burger and cauliflower sandwich I ordered. Didn't even know this place was here. I don't spend too much time dining in U City because it's mostly restaurants with overpriced crap.. but this little hole in the wall was dark, food was good, beer was cold.I came In 1 day for a bite to eat. Sat by the bar for maybe 5 minutes before getting someone's attention. (There was maybe 7 other people in the bar). No one really paid me any attention. A guy walks in with a dog, who was clearly a regular . Everyone rushed over to him just making convo but no one minded the dog in a restaurant . I excused myself. Dogs don't belong in restaurants . So unsanitaryThis is a great hometown watering hole if you are ever fortunately find yourself in the fine city of Philly. Divey, cozy, friendly, and in great walking distance from a lot of hotels and restaurants.This place was great for group of people; their beer and pizza was too large and delicious.
The peperoni pizza was too oily; but the crust was crispy and crunchy and so gooood! 
The mushroom onion pizza was awesome; also the crust was alao so good.
It's located in a beautiful neighborhood; yet if was not too crowded on the Friday night.Fun college bar, very popular among Penn students. Despite it being a "divey" bar, the interior is kinda classy-looking and is pretty spacious. Pretty cheap food and drinks. Cheap $0.50 drinks on Wednesdays (with a small cover).Dark, sticky, cheap, wonderful. Smoke's is definitely a Penn spot, so really, don't go here on a crowded night if you're going to complain about hating Penn undergrads. The bar is a PENNstitution after all... There's really not much to recommend Smoke's except for how incredibly cheap it is and the fact that if you're a Penn student, you can head over here and most likely run into some friends so you don't have to drink alone. Because that's just not a good path to be on. Oh, and Kweder. How could I almost forget Kweder?Love this place primarily because I work across the street and know almost all the bartenders and they all know me ... It's not a great place to dance the alcohol is cheap the scene is definitely Penn but o must admit it's a hit or miss depending on what you like.. though there are opportunities for those who like it quiet to enjoy themselves and those who want to be surrounded by college kids to enjoy themselves but for me it's a go:)horrible service. waited fifteen minutes sitting at an empty bar for the bartender to acknowledge us. after asking for food and beer menus was told to go sit at a table if we wanted food and then ignored for another ten minutes before we could order beer. I wish I could give it 0 stars.This is the place for the ultimate college vibe, the oldest bar on campus that never lets you down with its tap beers and large pizzas!What a disgrace! We came here on a Friday night at around 7 o'clock and there was NOBODY in the place. My husband ordered a glass of water and the bartender ROLLED HIS EYES and mouthed "OH COME ON!" as he rudely walked away. Even though we both bought expensive burgers and I bought a pricey glass of beer.. I guess people aren't allowed to just order water anymore!? 
THEN - Just when I thought this place couldn't get any worse, we finished our food and a COCKROACH ran across the bar. The bartender started flicking the roach with his bar rag, and god knows where the bug ended up... probably in the ice bucket, since that's where he disappeared to.
Don't go here. The bartender (old guy with grey hair) is a total asshole and they have cockroaches running across their bar. Need I say more?Clearly this is a dive bar, and that's ok. Until I went to the women's restroom...
I'm not sure if there is a women's sanitary waste bin or not, but between the two stalls it looks like everything that should be in the waste bin is now on the floor. I had to step over sanitary napkins to use the restroom. I was afraid that I would leave the bathroom with something stuck to my shoe, and moldy. After this I had to leave.  I don't even want to look at my beer.This place blows. If your a college student with a fake or a degenerate I guess it makes sense to go here but other than that the bartender didn't know what was on tap(that's kind of the job). In addition, we ordered food and the order came out wrong. He proceeded to check his "computer," (you ever look at something you've done completely wrong and you just gotta sell it cause your hung over? This was one of those times), and insisted that my wife was wrong. Yep, she was wrong on the food we ordered. Dude - go anywhere else. Smokey Joe's? More like Shitty Hoes. Also, not the first time this place SUCKED. Last time I got thereGreat pizza and cheap drinks! Went for a social and it was surprisingly really good! The room is actually pretty large and can accommodate large groups. Felt like more of a college bar than for young professionals.I stopped by out of curiosity because I was in the area.  Not my scene.   It's a college bar bordering on a dive.  Booze was cheap.  I'm sure if I was way way younger and looking for a cheap drunk I'd feel differently.The only reason this gets 3 entire stars is the pizza is bomb. But make sure you get it to go because this is basically a frat party bar with expensive prices for tiny plastic cup drinks and a very sticky floor. I'm sure if you're just drunk already anyway you'd have a good time. Also call ahead to make sure the kitchen is still open, it closes pretty early.We went to Smokey Joe's on a quiet weeknight, kind of late for dinner, but too early for a big college drinking crowd. The waitress had called out, so the bar tender helped us out for our meal. He was attentive, kind and helpful, if not apologetic that he was trying to get the hang of things! 
We ordered the nachos, chili, sausage sandwich and a beer, and each item was pretty much spot on. I didn't dig the sausage sandwich, but my boyfriend gobbled it up with dabs of mustard on top, so it had to be decent. I enjoyed the chili, and spooning it onto the cheesy nachos was the perfect combination. 
I'd come back to Smokey Joe's for a beer some time to see what the vibe is like when the bar is full. But to be honest, I kind of liked the quiet, chill restaurant with just a few patrons. 8:30pm on a weeknight for a yummy, inexpensive dinner and drinks. Be there or be square, University City folks.I straight up ALWAYS forget the name of this place, mixing it up with "Stogie Joe's", but I just call it "the place with the good fries by Penn". So yeah, the fries are amazing and I'm not a huge fries person and the pizza is also good. I've never had any trouble with the service and I think the guys working there have a lot of patience, more than myself for sure. I've never been there when it's been super busy, which is something I actually like about this place, even at peak hours you can always find a seat at the bar or at a table. If you want to conversate with your friends but also have the divey/sports atmosphere this is a good place to go. They have cheap  beer pitchers and are usually quick to serve.I was at Penn when Smokey Joe's moved from its former location on Walnut Street to his current location on 40th St. I can't believe that was over 40 years ago. Make no mistake about it this is a college campus bar/restaurant. I remember the menu being a bit more diversified and the food has always been good. But after four years and then enough partying perhaps my memory is just not that good and the menu is the same. As I said this is a college bar and the oldest one on the plane campus so it primarily caters To paint students and staff. But anyone will feel comfortable there no matter what their age. If you're in the area stop by. Then all honesty I wouldn't make a trip into Philadelphia because you're looking for a great restaurant. It's all about the Penn experienceSmokey Joe's was okay.  They had an okay selection of beer and could mix drinks, but really the problem was that they just couldn't handle a crowd on a Thursday evening.  Since it was so hard to get drinks (even though the place wasn't actually full) we ended up moving on after just one.  Didn't try any food here, so can't really speak to that.
I'll add though, might be a fun place when they have more staff, but if you intend to be able to talk, a busy night will be real loud.
