Went there today, and it was fantastic! The best part about it is that you get to choose how much of what you want. Sure, it can get pricy if you pack on the toppings. But it's healthy and yummy!The only reason this place got 2 stars is b/c the yogurt was good. I had the regular yogurt not the tart yogurt. It was tasty but expensive.I didn't even  fill the cup up halfway and it was $3.50. I also liked that they had a lot of different flavors. I got cake batter/cheesecake mix and cookies and cream/reeses peanut butter mix.  
The thing I was absolutely turned off by here was that they only allow one sample per person but they offer around 15 different yogurt flavors. I was there with my sister and we each got a sample of a different flavor in the little paper holder they give you. I asked for a spoon so that I could taste her sample and she could taste my sample  The employee told me NO because there's only 1 sample per person. I pointed out that we followed the policy of 1 sample each, I just wanted to taste her sample and she wanted to taste mine but we didn't want to lick it off, we wanted to use a spoon to make it more sanitary. He really tried to convince me that 1 sample per customer ALSO prohibited customers from sharing their samples with each other. That's ridiculous. There were 2 ppl and 2 samples. If we wanted to share our samples why did he care? Finally after i insisted he give me a spoon he passed us one. We then both got yogurt, paid and left. I will not be returning to Phileo yogurt. There are too many other yogurt shops in Philly.Finally had a chance to try this place when I was visiting Philly last weekend. It did not let me down. I swirled two flavors of froyo into my cup: lychee and kiwi. They were fantastic. For topping I piled on blueberries, kiwi (real fruit pieces), and mochi. I was in heaven. I wish they would open a store in NYC. Yes, we have Pinkberry and Red Mango (plus bazillion other froyo joints) all over the city but one can never have enough great froyo places to choose from and Phileo is up there on my list. Definitely will be back next time I'm in town despite their slightly out of the way South Street location. They will get six stars if they opened another store in Center City and seven stars for coming to NY!Phileo was the first frozen yogurt outpost to cash in on the Pinkberry trend and it stands as the best. 
It has the widest selection of flavors and self-serve toppings. The tart are the most satisfying, particularly in hot weather. Kids will like traditional flavors like chocolate. The brave have adventurous options, like Taro.
Relative to the competition: I'll give a nod to Yogarino for better texture and a purer plain yogurt flavor (think soft serve Fage). Sweet Endings is not even worth the trip.
The Double Big Gulp sized cups at Phileo are dangerously easy to overfill and, thus, overpay. Instead, make the most of their sample cups (ask if you don't see them) to find your favorite 3 or 4 flavors before you spend. 
Phileo's obnoxious South Street location is worth the hassle.Great flavors, and live cultures in the yogurt verify the high quality product. It also makes it an amazing lactose-free treat! 
This is another pay by the ounce type of place, with a topping bar you can hit up to your heart's content. Amazing prices. I filled a large container all the way up to the brim, topped it with Cap'n Crunch, and barely crossed the $6 mark. 
Very clean and well-kept. Credit cards accepted.OMG!! Philadelphia finally has Pinkberry style frozen yogurt!! My roommate and I have never been happier walking the streets of Philly until this day. It's been a month without yogurt for me and it's been killer!!
I will give a full review soon but this is just to inform you guys  that there is one out there!There's not a lot i can say about this place other than, great yogurt. If you don't know how it works, you get a huge cup to put as much of whatever flavor you'd like. then you move on to add your toppings and syrups. At the end they weight it and you pay based on that. Dont walk by this place without having some, you'll regret itThey arr closed at this location. If they moved what is the new address. Otherwise. Not a good poace to go for froyo. The fro is outside. The yo is at another store I guess. YOOOO!I mean, this ain't no Red Mango or Pinkberry. 
But...with that in mind...the plethora of flavors is kind of fun, although be aware -- they only let you sample one flavor (kind of lame of them, huh).
Anyways...sadly with the opening of the new yogurt place on 18th and chestnut, i'll have no more reason to come here!Standard self-serve fro-yo place. Yummy and refreshing and they had a Pumpkin flavor which was a nice touch for Autumn. However.. the neighborhood! A bit urban and rough. This place would do so much better and even seem better if it were in a fluffier neighborhood. Might be politically incorrect to say, but is business ever politically correct?I love this place.  This was the first place I EVER tried frozen yogurt (bar) before I even moved out to Cali.  After samppling nearly every yogurt place in LA, OC, and beach city in Cali, Phileo Yogurt proves to be my favorite, STILL.  And with all the Pinkbetrry hype, this is WAYYY better than Pinkberry.  You cant even self serve at Pinkberry!  And its way more expensive, too!  And the bitch screwed up my order at Pinkberry and was very rushed and rude. I would never go to another Pinkberry again.  3 flavors of yogurt and only a handful of toppings?? No thanks!
Ill take taro yogurt with mochi topping ANY day of the week. And to those who say its too icey: How many fro yo places have you been to?  This place is NO different than other.  If fact, its better.  FroYo isnt supposed to be creamy, like ice cream. Thats why its not as fattening, and called ice CREAM! DUH!!!
The only drawback is that this place is pricier - that price would go down if we had more fro yo places in the area.  Its still not a bad deal, and a fresh new concept for the Philadelphia area. Love it!This is the first frozen yogurt location I went to and love it! This location is clean and nicely decorated and arranged. I enjoy the variety of toppings. I heard Phileo is one of the first frozen yogurt spots to show up in Philly.I really never thought I'd be into this fro-yo trend, which reminds me of all of the sheep in LA who flock to this very kind of BS. But Phileo is absolutely delicious.
Phileo's frozen yogurt does not have that usual fat-free, sour cream-ish kind of taste to it that turns me off from a lot of other places. The flavors are all great (especially the red velvet) and they have plenty of toppings. The flavors rotate frequently and the "yogurt techs" have little medicine cups to give out to try stuff before you buy it.
Payment is by weight as there are no sizes and it is self serve. This is good in one way because you can get the amount that you want but bad in another because it is pretty expensive (hence the minus one star). It was around $9 for two moderately sized yogurts, and no super heavy toppings. But it is delicious, so I don't care.The City of Brotherly Love gets to take part in all the froyo madness -- not with a Pinkberry, Red Mango, or Yogiberry -- but with PHILEO.  
Buyer beware: as one of the pictures on this site, you can see that the customer has control of how much froyo to put in his/her cup.  Pile it on and youll pay for each ounce.  As such, it can get pricey for the overly ambitious first-time buyer.  Also, I had this odd feeling that the fruit wasnt super fresh -- it looked like it was exposed out in the air for hours.  
The establishment itself is very clean and if you can score a seat at the table along the stores front window, it can make for an exciting people-watching venue as you see people wander around South Street.  
I wonder how this will fare when Yogorino opens up near Rittenhouse Square sometime soon...The quality of the yogurt at this establishment deserves 5 stars.  It's creamy and flavorful and I really cannot believe that it's yogurt.  The reason I only gave 4 stars is because I don't really like their form of marketing.  They advertise 49 cents per ounce, leading you to believe that it is inexpensive, but it's quite the opposite.  Even the smallest cup is HUGE, leaving you to fill it more than you probably would if it were smaller.  Even with the tiniest bit of yogurt I have never spent less than 5 dollars here.  Behind me in line one day was a little girl who filled up her cup, not knowing any better, and it cost her $15!  I understand that it's weighed by the ounce, but I think it's a little misleading and would much prefer the small/medium/large price method.It's no PinkBerry, but at least it doesn't eat your soul, or whatever PinkBerry's downfall is. Or was it shady ingredients? 
The cup sizes are a bit out of whack and pretty huge -- but you know America, the bigger the cup size, the better. It's obvious that they want you to feel obligated to fill a giant cup with froyo and shove all the toppings you can into it and thus pay $10 for a cup of ice cream...and I sure as hell will. Every time.
The plain tart is interesting but you'll find it at pretty much every new-age yogurt place in Philly or otherwise. I'm also not sure why they're so stingy on the samples. If I'm in a mental war between lychee and green tea froyo and I've never tasted either before, I'm certainly not going to pray that the one I didn't sample is good if one sucked. 
The have a ton of toppings ranging from the typical -- peanuts, M&M's, chocolate syrup -- to less-conventional ones like Cap'n Crunch and Fruity Pebbles. But more power to ya if you feel like loading up on those.Excellent selection! You're able to sample the fro-yo, and there's a lot of toppings to choose from.
Great addition to South Street!My favorite place to get froyo! They don't have a lot of seating, but the amount of flavors make up for that. This is the only place that carries my all time favorite, lychee froyo, and I will keep coming back for it !Sweet elephants on tricycles!  Zounds! By the beard of Zeus! I'm so overwhelmed I don't know what to do with myself... or maybe I just have a sugar high from all the fro-yo I just ingested.
You know that Simpsons episode where Homer is transported to a magical world where everything is made of chocolate?  Phileo is kind of like that.  And by that I mean it's colorful, sugar laden, a bit overwhelming, and ultimately perfect to satisfy your every gluttonous sugar craving.  
There was a whole WALL of Fro-Yo flavors.  I'm normally content with one flavor and one mixing, but since it's all self-serve and you're charged by the ounce, I decided to try three (Taro, Chocolate, and Vanilla.  I'd like to think it's a classy reinvention of Neopolitan.)  They were all excellent, especially when mixed with chocolate chips from the self-serve mixin bar.  That's where I got truly overwhelmed... it was literally like being let loose in a candy store, and some part of my brain just exploded when I got to it.  I'm still recovering now, to be exact.
It's a shame I'm moving on Sunday, 'cause I'd love to come back.  Now that I've had a taste of the sweet sugary goodness, I want MORE!I am absolutely addicted to this place.
My favorite flavor, which no one has mentioned yet, is PINEAPPLE! Capogiro doesn't even have pineapple gelato (that i know of) and pineapple waterice is just gross so when I saw the sign I just had to try.
My usual?
Chocolate+Pineapple+New Flavor, then mochi
++++I really enjoy Kiwi, Plain, Snickerdoodle
I haven't tasted anything icy yet! And yes, it does melt kind of quickly but I don't mind so much because, well, I just eat it WITH THE SPOON!
The owners are a little overprotective but they nearly recognize me, which is nice. If they could speak better English it'd seem like a modern day family owned fountain soda place.
It does get kind of expensive kind of fast, but I eat a lot and even when I've piled on all that I could eat the most it's ever come to is $7.32, and it was a $7.32 kind of experience. 
The crowds can be kind of annoying. I try to duck in there when there's no one there (difficult, but worth it) because the people who frequent the place are generally teenyboppers and their suburban moms, having a grand ole time on south st, which bugs the shit out of me to no end.
All that being said, I'd brave all those problems just for that sweet phileo philling.The spectacle that was my frozen yogurt was made up of:
1. Vanilla frozen yogurt
2. Fresh strawberries
3. Fresh blueberries
4. Mini chocolate chips
5. Mochi 
6. Slivered almonds 
I kept my eye on the mochi bits because they were unique and I had just been to a sushi place for dinner, so I kept the theme alive.  
My best advice: if it's your first time concocting your own frozen yogurt cup, go with flavors that you love. Be adventurous with prudence. My sister decided that her first creation would contain kiwi tart frozen yogurt. Unless you like sour foods...don't try that first.My favorite froyo spot in the city. Very clean & the fruit is all so fresh. 
I usually get the vanilla with a ton of fruit whenever I'm in the hood.I had a public spazz out when I discovered this place. I stopped in my tracks and said out loud - alone, mind you - "Dear God, what is THIS?" The other yelpers pretty much summed it up. The one missing star is cause this stuff is pricey, but that is partly because the first few times you go you will overfill your cup!The BEST FroYo shop I've ever been! I love the atmosphere and self serve is quite amazing with many different choices to choose from. There is even a table full of toppings and it's just very delicious! I'm writing this review pretty late as I've visited last year, but if you're a fan of ice cream, you'll love this this place! My only option is that it's quite easily to fill your cup up to the top and just go over board with everything. The pricing goes by weight, so it can become very expensive even though this place is shown as cheap (go small and it can be cheap), at times depending on how much you get, it can be $$$. Give this place a visit, you'll most likely enjoy it!I LOVE THIS PLACE! Only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because its a little on the pricey side... But clearly I still go there constantly so its not that much of a problem. Before stepping into this place, I have never had the joy of tasting frozen yogurt that ACTUALLY TASTED like yogurt. With that being said, their "plain tart" is amazing. It will keep me forever going back.I love Froyo
Phileo Yogurt = not so much.
I mean... it was 105 degrees outside.  It wouldn't have taken much to make me happy.  But it was melty and more expensive than the other froyo places I've been.  
And what's with the massive cups?  Need I go on ANOTHER unamerican rant about portions...?Blue Berry Tart with Fruity Pebbles on top... nom nom nom. Phileo is by far my favorite frozen yogurt place in the city.I lovedddd the taro flavor~
everything's pretty fresh and eye-pleasing, which is great. After sampling so many froyo places in new york, I was so relieved to find a decent place in Philly.
I also tried the plain tart but I don't really like it.  it's too tangy for my taste, but that's just personal preference since I love Red Mango's original flavor better.
my toppings included:
1-mochi
2-strawberries
3-captn crunch
the decor is cute but there aren't many places to sit, so expect to come in, grab and go! it's all self-serve :) so be careful of your portions!Phileo has earned itself some stars back since my first horrific encounter.  Since then, I've been pleasantly surprised by the almost anti-septic store front and the carefully displayed candy/fruit buffet.  What a treat!I was walking South St with my kids and we popped into this place. Overpriced and no samples. I paid $10 for not even 1 full cup. If you see it, keep walking.I wasn't always convinced that frozen yogurt was a viable alternative to ice cream, but, as people have stated, I think it's changed in the past few years.  It's delicious and no 
t just for people on diets.  Phileo has excellent tasty fro yo with fresh toppings! The taste guy is always willing to give an extra taste and his favorite flavor is always lychee.  I know because I ask.  My suggestion would be to mix a few fruit or a few candy based yogurts, but does that honestly need to be said?
We frequent South Street often and this is our favorite frozen yogurt place.I really cannot believe all the reviewers who say they love this place.  I thought the concept was great and the design is fun, but what a disappointment when i tasted it!  Kind of a weird product - doesn't taste creamy like good fro-yo should and despite all the pictures and fluff about the health of the fruit toppings... the lack of actual nutritional info makes me wonder what's really in this stuff.
Bottom line:  it just doesn't taste good!Now that I've calmed down, I can write a more accurate review.  Initially I was thrilled to find a Pinkberry clone in Philly.  However, some of the fruit looked as if it had been sitting there for hours-- think browned apples, EW!!  In fact I had to stick to dry toppings which was a bummer.  Also, the yogurt melted faster than any froyo I've ever had.  It was kinda gross.  And the prices were sky high given the quality of the ingredients-- per ounce more $ than San Francisco froyo.  What?!?!  I'm on South St, right?  This amounted to $5 for a mediocre treat.
BUT, it is a place in Philly that serves tart froyo.  3 stars for trying.This just does not compare in creaminess and deliciousness to Sweet Ending, where I always get the Peanut Butter (to die for) but enjoy cream cheese and others as well.
Here, I had Heath bar and NY Cheesecake, and you could tell water had been added to both. 
The toppings were vast (props for carob chips) but the Reese's cups weren't crushed to a good size. Otherwise, standard.I LOVE Phileo Yogurt. The fro-yo... the toppings... the people. ALL WONDERFUL! 
I am absolutely head-over-heels in love with their Pineapple and Lychee tart. It makes me go "oOo la la" especially when I top it with my must-have Fruitty Pebbles. Yum! Ugh, this place is HEAVEN ON EARTH on a hot summer day.Some of you may not be familiar with the tart flavored yogurt or Pinkberry so I'll give a brief description. Think of what normal plain-flavored Yoplait yogurt tastes like but now in a frozen yogurt form and that's what you get! Hmm, maybe that didn't make it sound as good as it actually tastes. :P
Anyway, try this place! I love Pinkberry and all those yogurt places that are popping up everywhere but I was quite sad to see that Philly didn't have one until now. Woohoo!!
Steps to getting yogurt:
1. Grab a bowl
2. Head over to the 15+ different yogurt machines
3. Pick your poisons (go crazy with the flavors!)
4. Add dry and fresh fruit toppings (MUST get MOCHI and fruity pebbles!!!)
5. Weigh the bowl and pay per ounce
6. ENJOY!!!
My usual order: plain tart with mochi, fruity pebbles, mango, and kiwi. 
This place is actually part of Yogurtland so if you've ever tried that, it is very similar in terms of flavors. There are many different flavors here including the classic chocolate and vanilla. Other flavors include green tea, mango tart, strawberry tart, blueberry tart, plain tart, cookies 'n creme,  taro, snickerdoodle, and many more. I'm not a big fan of the green tea here. Either way, you will not get bored! While the vanilla and chocolate flavor is the typical creamier yogurt, the tart flavored yogurts are a bit icier and less sweet (which I like!). In terms of the flavor and texture of the plain tart, it is very similar to Pinkberry and not too tart as is Yogurtland (although it's from the same company). Texture is also good and does not melt fast. They also sell smoothies there but I haven't tried yet. 
In terms of their toppings, there's not much you can't get. They have all the traditional stuff like chocolate chip, nuts, cookie dough, sprinkles, oreo, etc. In terms of the more interesting stuff, they have MOCHI (again, MUST GET!!), cereals (fruity pebbles, coco puffs, captain crunch), and candy bars. They also have a good selection of fresh fruit such as strawberry, kiwi, mango, blueberry, peach, raspberry, etc. Like I said, how can you get get bored with a place like this?! :)
The place is also very clean and cutely decorated (see pic). The downside here though is that there isn't too much seating. Maybe enough seats for 15 people max.
In terms of price, it is a bit pricey. Definitely pricier than I'm used to. It's 49 cents/once (I'm used to 38 cents) but this place is definitely still worth it. 5 star just for being the first in Philly! :DSo I've demoted Phileo down to 4 stars... I took the kids the other day when we were in the city because it was BLAZING hot.  Thought the trek in town would kill some time while we waited for rush hour traffic to abate.  
The kids got fruity flavored froyo with fruit toppings which they LOVED.  All the fruit was fresh and flavorful so I was pleased with that.  I got the lychee froyo, which I also loved, but I wasn't so happy with my toppings.  I LOVE LOVE LOVE mochi and I love red beans, but they were both subpar.  The red beans had a bitter aftertaste that should not have been there.  The mochi was also a little off...  The red beans were so nasty that it actually ruined my whole froyo experience.  I tried to eat around them, but I dunno... it just killed it for me.  For 6 bucks, I should not have had to eat around anything.  And since we only put 15 minutes on the meter, we had to bail and eat our froyo on the way to the car.  
I was also forced to agree with others here that yeah, Phileo's froyo does melt WAY too fast.  It was liquid within 5 minutes of purchase.  Perhaps that's why it has such a nice light flavor and is so refreshing, but I should have been able to walk a half block to my car without my frozen delight being reduced to a puddle.
Phileo, I think our love-affair is gonna be short lived.After a night of drinking margaritas and nomnomnoming down cheese steaks, what better way to end the evening than a cup of strawberry covered in toppings so much that you can't even see the frozen treat below.I love this place.
I've only been here few times over the last 4yrs.  But, all those times were when I craved some frozen desert treats.
It's quite out of the way for me to get there, but after stumbling into the doorway by accident the first time, I fell in love with it.
I've never had frozen yogurt at any other place than Phileo to compare - hence the 4 star rating.  May be there is a better option.
But, for me, this is the only one I'd consider going to whenever I'm in the mood for some frozen treats, even if I have to drive an hour to get there....This is my favorite place to go when we visit Philadelphia.  The taro yogurt is amazing, and most of the other ones are too.  It definitely has a certain look going for it, but that's okay because it's really good.  Especially the little mochi pieces! Wish it was a little cheaper though.Just downright awesome. Pick a few flavors of awesome yogurt and indulge on their toppings bar, it's packed with great choices! I need more Phileo in my life!Phileo yogurt is amazing!!
personally, I like frozen yogurt better than ice cream and this place is def. a place to go especially if you're picky... =]
they have variety of flavors to choose from, tons of toppings you can just add however much you want, and they let you sample a flavor too! 
I only wish the place had more seats... but hey it's the city! 
If only I lived closer... I would have it for breakfast, lunch, and dinner! (JK... =b)You can walk into this frozen yogurt shop, grab a cup, and self-serve away. It's easy to load up on tons of flavors (tart yogurt, mango, green tea) and have your toppings (fresh strawberries, captain crunch, kiwi) follow suit. But don't be greedy, you'll pay for your glorious yogurt mountain when the cashier weighs your cup. I'm waiting for them to add mochi to their arsenal of toppings...do they still not have it?Ok, so I haven't had as much experience with "froyo" joints as some of the other yelpers reviewing this place, but I absolutely, LOooOVE Phileo Yogurt. I usually prefer ice cream to frozen yogurt, and for years I've actually hated the taste of frozen yogurt, but I tried me some of that stuff they served here, and was hooked! I don't mind the "large" pieces of fruit, and I don't even notice the "icy" consistency. But don't forget, I am unedumacated in the subject of froyo places. All I know is: chocolate, cheesecake & taro froyo+ PB cups, coconut flakes, cheesecake bits, blueberries and strawberries= an effin, happy-ass mouthful of taste buds.I haven't reviewed this place?
I HAVEN'T REVIEWED THIS PLACE?!?!?!
WHAT IS WRONG WITH ME?!?! I've been coming here regularly since it first opened (I knew about it even before it came to South Street!) and I still can't get enough! I love Phileo Yogurt (its the same at Yogurtland in NYC)!! Self serve froyo is the way its meant to be; I mean, haven't you always wanted to pull the handle on those machines and swirl together whatever flavors you want, with whatever toppings you want? SWEET LORD YES!
They offer a variety of flavors that they rotate - Pumpkin right now is where its at, although Taro will forever be my favorite flavor - usually more than enough options for anyone, but remember to pair wisely or you will regret choosing peanut butter and tart mango. The toppings are the typical options at these types of places: fresh fruit (pomegranate is now being featured!) and tons of dry toppings including cheesecake pieces, cookie dough pieces, mochi, chocolate chips, shredded coconut, granola, Butterfinger, Oreos, peanut butter cups....its endless when you think about it, and there's no way you could ever fit every single topping in one cup WITH the froyo.
My one gripe? The price! 49 cents per ounce?! Its 37 cents in NYC!!! Isn't Philly supposed to be cheaper? Isn't that one reason why I moved here? Shouldn't I be able to gorge on froyo to my heart's content without paying massive amounts? I mean, its still a good deal when you think about it - you are completely customizing YOURSELF from all the options they offer to you. BUT I WANT MORE!This place is great! It is a self-serve fro-yo place that prices by weight. You just walk in, get a bowl, choose your yogurt flavor(s), and scoop the toppings on. 
This place has the most flavors I've seen a fro-yo place. I think they must have around 15 different flavors. They have the standard fro-yo toppings - fruits, candies, and my fave mochi!
I got taro with mochi toppings. It was delicious. The taro flavor is light - a definite must-try. As for the mochi, you can never go wrong with mochi, it goes with everything. 
This place is awesome!!! :)This is the first self-serve froyo place that I've visited. I can say that I am now a huge fan and it has made my visit to Philly a bit sweeter. 
The atmosphere is bright and I love the bright colors on the walls and the bright lights. You can definitely point out Phiieo easily on South Street with its glass front. 
The self-serve machines are easily accessible; all you need to do is walk straight towards the back and your in line! Various types of flavors besides the original tart. Probably has the most variety of flavors compared to the other self-serve froyo place I've visited afterwards. 
The toppings are fresh and sweet. So much variety. The froyo itself is sweeter and creamier than Pinkberry but still has a slight tart flavor that is a must for froyo. 
Overall, I would definitely visit this place whenever I visit Philly.Came here with my cousins who were visiting from out of town. The location inside is very cute. They have white chairs and tables where you can sit and relax. The froyo flavor options and toppings were plentiful.
It's a little pricey for my taste but it's clean and fruit was fresh.Great froyo friendly service & the fresh fruit topping always look like they were just cut place is always very clean and furniture is very cool & modernMy favorite frozen yogurt place.  Ever.  Period.  End of story.
Ten flavors of yogurt, clean, plenty of toppings, and pay by the ounce?  Yes, please. 
If only I lived in Philadelphia.  
But then I would be fat on fro-yo.Their frozen yogurt is really good, especially the cupcake batter! Not only their frozen yogurt is good, their fruits are great also! I always go there because their fruits are fresh (especially the mangos!) I highly recommend Phileo just because they're close to many other stores and there's a lot of parking spaces.I love, love, love this place. My friends on the west coast might kill me for saying that because Phileo Yogurt is a knock off from Yogurt Land, but I don't care. (I doubt they even read my Yelp page anyway.)
Phileo Yogurt is the east coast version of Yogurt Land, and it's amazing. Red Velvet Cake with fresh strawberries is so damn good! Why haven't we had a self serve yogurt place in the city before now? 
Keep in mind, it's little pricey for a frozen treat (I think between the two of us it was $14), but again, it's worth it. OMG, see now I'm going to have to visit this weekend! (Maybe Ikeas too while I'm up that way.)I had my first introduction to the self serve froyo concept here soon after it opened, and I have been obsessed ever since. Abundant yogurt flavors and toppings, all great quality. It's a must-stop whenever we're on South Street, or whenever we're in Philly, really.NOM-NOMS! Phileo is quite the little yogurt shop. It has flavors that will satisfy any taste bud and it is refreshingly original. I did, however, come across a moment of... this fro-yo isn't SPECTACULAR. Truthfully, I tasted the banana and green tea soft-serve and found it to be pretty average. It's not all that smooth, and seeing as it's low in fat, not all that creamy either. The topping selection is bangin' though! Phileo deserves props for keeping this place as clean as it was when I got myself a cup!I love this place.  My husband and I go here when we walk the dog on the weekends.  The yogurt is delicious, and I always feel welcome.Every time I enter this establishment my heart races and my mind begins a complicated series of mathematical computations involving ratios of fro yo to various toppings.  The possibilities are mindboggling!  Remember back to the simple days of chocolate, vanilla, or swirl?  Ha!  Indecisive people could stand here all day, empty cup in hand.  But the beauty of the self-serve system is that you can mix it up and try as many of the fro yo flavors, sauces, fruit, nut & candy toppings as your heart desires.  
Yes I feel vaguely foolish paying like $6 for a cup of yogurt.  And if frozen yogurt isn't innately exciting to you then Phileo probably won't make you a convert.  But to me, this is definitely a little piece of heaven, which is why I have no choice but to bequeath the full 5 stars.  I just wish there was something exactly like it closer to my 'hood (Bryn Mawr).WOOT WOOT! They got Mochi for the yogurt...now the place IS perfect!  
I love the concept of being able to decide just how much you want to eat, and how much you want to put on top. They have a GREAT selection of toppings, including fresh fruit, mochi, and the run of the mill candies. 
Great place, now they just need some more seats to enjoy it! Outside seating would be rad...but then again it is south street so I'm not holding my breath!okay the yogurt isnt horrible. I've seen other yogurt places that have more flavors. Of the flavor choices, they werent that great. On the bright side, the place is clean and the fruit looked fresh. 
I was there tonight, and the guy cleaning up around the yogurt was very rude to my boyfriend accusing him of eating the yogurt before we weighed and paid for it. I wont go back, considering there are much better options with people who arent rude.  Sorry Phileo Yogurt.. you lost loyal customers.Oh dearest froyo location, how you have only improved since the last time we met. Your clean, friendly layout bursting with green, white and other colors draws me in as a moth to the flame. Your myriad flavors leave me hypnotized and longing for more. Your taro and lychee flavors are the best in the land, and your cake flavors are none to reckon with either. My how your toppings bar is fresh and neat. Kiwi, mango, mochi, jimmies, cake bites, and more complete the perfect cup. Phileo, you had me at "ph-".  As in the best "phroyo" in Phileoyogurtelphia.
Honestly, this place is still my favorite in the city. It's a shame it has to be on South St. and not next to my apartment.This place is delicious, but they watch you like a hawk when you are sampling the flavors. I guess the rule is that you can only try 1 and they are literally standing behind you watching! Haha! 
Come on, Phileo! One more bite of yogurt is probably going to get us hooked so we have to add 4 flavors to our huge cups instead of 3. Then you can charge us $10 for fro yo instead of $7.50! OK, so I tend to go overboard at this place, but who wouldn't with a cup that size?
I'd recommend Phileo if you're in the area, but beware of the sample stalkers.I came here over 2months ago and I forgot to review. I can't recall what I got but i usually mix 2flavors and add a bunch of crunchy nutty toppings.
I enjoyed it. How can you not? If you don't like, it's your own damn fault. That's the way I see it.
The one thing that disturbs me about frozen yogurt establishments and I  have seen this at many other establishments- FLIES. Flies around the topping buffet area. That just irks me because you know, they've landed on something in that mix. GROSS. 
They need a more fly proof display area i think.
I still think pink berry is the bestest but while in philly I'll come here.Oh my love.  Best fro yo I've ever had.  HUGE selection of flavors - I went with the cupcake batter, swirled with a bit of chocolate.  They also had Reeses, cookies and cream, blueberry tart, peach, sour apple...you name it, they had it.  There were also lots of tasty, fresh toppings.  My only complaint - they are stingy with the samples!  Only one per customer?  Maybe they are mitigating the problem of having people come in and only sample, not buy.  Who knows.  Also there are signs posted everywhere warning you not to eat any yogurt before you pay...ok, that's the norm.  Again, maybe this is an issue at this particular fro yo joint.
Anyway, I was in heaven while eating my chocolate-cupcake batter fro yo topped with brownie crumbles, a few cookie dough crumbles, sprinkles, and chocolate syrup.  Also, I'm one of those people who usually ends up weighing my yogurt and discovering that I've just made an $8 creation.  Not this time - I was out the door for just over $5, including a tip.  What a steal!  Love this place.frozen yogurt heaven!
it's self serve. get as much or as little as you want! it's 49cents an ounce. watch out for heavier toppings like fruit...the weight can get you.
today i got a delicious reeses peanut butter cup yogurt (i'm a sucker for chocolate and peanut butter together). they also lots of other stuff like green apple tart, new york cheesecake, and regular flavors like chocolate among other delicious flavors. 
the toppings bar is amazing. it's so hard to choose what i want (i know i'll end up putting a little of all my favorites in the cup anyway). cheesecake or cookie dough pieces, reeses or butterfinger, berries and kiwi, oats, sprinkles. i never know what to get! i want it all!
i love sitting at the bar-like counter near the windows to people watch while i cool down with this AH-MAZ-ING yogurt on hot days.**WHY 3 STARS?**
I'm a froyo snob. I can be picky about everything, even frozen yogurt.  I happen to come from the land where the trend originated where there's frozen yogurt served around every corner.  The yogurt here is not bad, but it's like every other self-serve place I've tried.  Lots of toppings and flavor selections, but I'll still have my Pinkberry any day.
**Recommend?** Sure, why not? I wouldn't go out of my way to come here though.I like that I can decide just how much yogurt I want (you pay by the ounce) and exactly which toppings to put on the yogurt. If I am feeling particularly virtuous, I can stick with the fruit toppings, but if I'm not, I can have the crushed Oreos and brownie bites and other really good stuff. Yeah, it's not cheap, but it's a nice treat, especially on a beautiful day in the summer.I've done self-serve yogurt out in cali, but this yogurt joint beats out even those places.
They have 3 interesting flavors that all tasted great - cheesecake, reeces pieces, and cupcake batter.  I sampled the first, but got RP and CB in my cup.  You're only allowed one sample per person.
They have all the usual toppings.  I like mixing it up, but I ended up getting choc sprinkles, graham cracker dust, cheesecake bites, brownie bites, cookie dough bites, and white choc chips.
It cost .49 per half oz I think as I believe my cup weighed about 6oz or so and it came to $5 and some change.
Overall the flavors available were well worth it.  There was no line and its only a block away from Jim's Steaks for those who like that place.  The toppings available should be enough to satisfy most taste buds.I can't believe I went 4 weeks without knowing about this place!  I like it better than Pinkberry because of the self serve and variety!  
You are in control of how much, what stacking order, and how many toppings you can add!  
$0.49/ounce
I tried it straight up asian style: Taro + Green Tea + Red Bean topping. 
I'm sad I didn't see the mochi topping!  I might have to go back tomorrow...and the next day...and the next day...
Soon, they'll have smoothies and frappes, HOORAY!
I only hold back on the star because I think they need more seating and perhaps a bit more TLC in their signage and presentation.I'm a big fan of the tangy yogurt craze and Phileo has satisfied my cravings! I went there on a hot day and it really hit the spot. Not only did they have the plain flavor, but over 8 other flavors (ranging from pineapple and mango to red bean and taro!) And, unlike other froyo places, you can take as many toppings as you want- it's a pay-by-weight deal. Toppings include: coconut, berries, cereals, and chocolate pieces. Delish! I will definitely be going back.Not my first time having frozen yogurt, however I am a first time patron of Phileo. I was surprised to see that the only size cups available were large. If you decide to come here be prepared to spend more that you anticipated just because of the sheer size of the cups. The frozen yogurt was delicious and at the correct temperature. Nothing was unclean. The person who was at the register was nice and helpful. The toppings bar is by far one of the best I have ever seen. I would recommend coming here just be wary of the prices.Oh Phileo, Phileo...
How long I have waited to consummate what I knew would be a life-long love affair.  When I woke up today, I didn't know that today would be THE day.  But it was.  It's been but 3 short hours since we parted, and already my taste buds are pining for you...
I hate all things trendy.  But I'd heard tales of Phileo, Red Mango, and Crackberry and knew our destinies were intertwined.  Our joining was inevitable.  I had cause to be in the city today with about 45 minutes to kill.  I was lucky enough to find a parking spot around the corner from Phileo on 5th street and hoofed on over with my 3 year old.  The half block walk was all it required for the whining to commence.  But it was worth it.
The wall full of tempting flavors, some common, others not... hmmm what to have.  I opted for the mild green tea and the tangy and tantalizing lychee (ohhhhh sooooooo good!) topped with mochi.  mochi mochi mochi i loooooove mochi.  Was so excited about the mochi forgot to add the red beans.  Oh well.  The baby had blueberry yogurt with fresh plump blueberries and mango.  For two modest servings it was $8.50.  Slightly overpriced, but worth it.  
My only complaint is Phileo is not designed for comfort.  They have enough seating for about 12 people comfortably.  It's a joke.  Hurry up and eat you frozen yogurt and go home already.  But you'll be back, oh yes, you WILL.I was in Philadelphia and had a sudden craving for yogurt.  Of course, Yogurtland was the first thing that popped into my mind however, this was the closest thing I could find.  The yogurt was actually pretty good.  I chose the lychee flavor (I'm a fruity yogurt lover) and topped it with berries.   I was surprised at the price.  It was quite pricey...it cost about $9 for one cup!  At Yogurtland, this same cup would have only cost me about $6.  But alas, beggers can't be choosers, right?  
Aside from the price, the workers were not particularly friendly and only allowed one sample.  They practically guarded the yogurt dispensers. It made for an unpleasant experience.  Perhaps they had customers who abused the free samples in the past?  Who knows.I will always be a pinkberry lover. BUT! I was definitely feelin' red velvet and lychee froyo. 
I like the self serve style but I fail at making my cup look decent, so no pictures! Does anyone know if the prices (per weight) are higher than sweet endings? 
Cool place, good frozen yogurt, and spring weather. Life is good :)if you're a taro bubble tea fan like me, then the taro froyo here will be like HEAVEN to you. its a genius idea to charge by weight. that way, unlike pinkberry, you can have every topping if you want! and you dont have to worry about spending a fortune on froyo.
ALSO- you're able to sample every flavor if u want and you get to control the amount of your sample! its GREAT!
only downfall: fruit is cut too big. HOWEVER, this is not enough for it to lose a star. every time i visit philly i will def pay phileo yogurt a visit.New ownership...the only place around that serves the awesome TARO flavor! 
Love their mochi mixture...that's an extra star given!I enjoyed a tasty combination of cake batter, cheesecake bites, and nilla wafers crumbles. It was refreshing and hit the spot. This place was super clean and the staff was friendly. I don't eat ice cream often and prefer frozen yogurt. Nice spot to go on the infamous South Street.This is based on my visit in August. The flavor wasn't as much cupcake batter that me and my fiance shared as I would like, but, it was still good. Pricing is just right, too.I came here for dessert after having a cheesesteak at Jim's Steaks when I was on vacation in Philly and I got the green tea frozen yogurt and I didn't really care for it, the strawberries and the oreos on it we're great though and it cost like 6 bucks and change so it just wasn't worth the money.Much room for improvement. The yogurt is watery, a bad way to start. Limited flavored and toppings, no hot fudge???? Who wants chocolate flavored syrup? 
I do like the fresh fruit they sell 2 for $5This is by far the best frozen yogurt on the planet.  I used to think Pinkberry would beat it, BUT I had Pinkberry a few months ago and it was just so-so. Phileoyogurt wins with me!!! The variety of tart flavors does it- they taste like a chewy Sweetart made into delicious frozeness. YUM!  I travel there from Bucks County twice a month and get a few tubs to go so I can freeze them at home. Worth the trip, check it out!!Phileo might just win my internal froyo battle- and it definitely takes the cake, East of Broad. I love that there are dozens of flavors- especially lychee and mounds!! YUM! And the toppings- don't even get me started. Lychee froyo + Reeses peanut butter cups = love (sort of a pbj sandwich with an Asian flair). I went with my boyfriend last week and we spent $17 on froyo...we may have gone a bit overboard!
Here are two things I was not a fan of, though:
1. You only get to try one flavor. I had never been before, and I am really picky. I think they are probably trying to deter mooching teenagers, but come on...I'm a yuppie and I am probably going to drop at least $5 on something that was practically free for you to make. Let me taste around to see what I like!
2. It was...how do I say this...sort of dirty. The toppings bar was really messy, and it almost looked like people had stuck their hands in the stuff. Not to compare and cross post (but I will anyway because that's what I do), but it strikes me that Sweet Ending gets about the same amount of traffic in Rittenhouse, and Sweet Ending has always been immaculate. Step it up, Phileo!
Overall, the options rock. But I can't get past my two complaints, so it will have to be a 3-star until proven otherwise!
