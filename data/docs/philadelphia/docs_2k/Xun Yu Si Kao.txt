We placed the order for sweet sour fish(supposedly not spicy) it turned out very spicy. We asked for not spicy, that's what we got. Thank you so much to ruin my day !!!!!!!Very authentic Szechuan food and good service. If you love spicy food, you can't miss this restaurant. Their cold dishes are amazing and I love all of them.When I first walked into the resuraunt I liked the rustic atmosphere it had. After waiting 10 minutes for us the order we waited over 40 minutes for our dishes to come. The service was very slow here despite not being super busy. We ordered one of their specialty dishes (kao yu) and it was well cooked and seasoned. The food here was not good enough to justify the price.Was confused by Imperials multiple doors and wandered into this place on a whim.  What's the difference between the sesame chicken and general tso we ordered? Nothing is the answer. I know this place is know for it's fish but disappointed at the lack of finesse with these dishes. And it tasted like bbq sauce on top of it all.  Pros: large servings. Cons: food wasn't what we ordered. Oh well.It takes 30 minutes for the cold dishes and 45 minutes for the fish. Taste good but mehhhh..Very good.  
Great balance of flavor and spices in the dishes. 
One of two places I'll bother getting ma po tofu in Philadelphia.Best grilled fish in the east coast! Authentic Sichuan flavor and the brand is from china~Their signature dish is their grill fish. You can pick what kind of fish you want as well as choose your flavor from almost 10 flavors. We ordered the first one on the menu and it's really good. Other dishes are good too. The only thing that concerns us is the small portion of the dish. That means it can get pricy if you want get full.NEW REVIEW, READ BELOW FOR MY ORIGINAL:
So you guys all know that I really love spicy fish and it's one of my favorite things to eat. But I'm very disappointed to tell you that this place has inconsistent quality and when you're playing $70 for a meal for 2 people, that becomes unacceptable. We always ordered the striped bass with the Sichuan peppercorns and it had previously often came out delicious leaving us craving for it week after week. But this Friday we ordered our usual and it came out to be this watered down mess (the fish didn't taste all too fresh). It's like they diluted the Sichuan sauce with plain water so the fish was boiling in water when Sichuan sauce is supposed to be oil based. The skin is also soggy when previously it was nicely grilled charred. I voiced my frustrations to the waiter and they were able to make me a new dish BUT the new one came out tasting the same as the previous one. Not sure what is going on -- if they changed chefs or whatnot but I am so disappointed and will not be coming back.This is the best Szechuan style restaurant ever. If you're a Chinese looking for authentic Szechuan food, make sure to check this place out!First time here, food was good, so was the service. We ordered a yam with blueberries as an appetizer. For entrees, we ordered a spicy fish dish with some sides, it was really delicious and really spicy! The amount is enough for at least 3-4 people. There were three of us and we didn't finish it. One con is that it's pretty pricey, about $90 with tip.Honestly, I loved the food here.  I had a dish of sticky rice around spare ribs.  Really delicious.  And it is a type of Asian cuisine that you don't see much anywhere.  But it's quite pricey.  It was nearly $20 and not a lot of food.  Bring prices down a few dollars and this would be a five star place.The environment is good and the waiters are really nice. However, the price is little high since the fish is pretty small. Also, you need to add other items in the fish to make it a complete dish. So it will be about 70 bucks for two.Loved it! Everything was amazing from the customer service to the food and ambience of the restaurant! They have original Chinese dishes and American Chinese dishes. Perfectly flavored!If you are willing to pay 50 bucks for a very small fish plus at least 10 more for the side dish in the pot, plus some appetizers highly recommended by the waiter, then give it a try. Expect some cost at around $40 per person. The food is not too bad after all.这是我在费城附近吃过最正宗的烤鱼. 我是重庆人，他们在重庆真的有店. This is the most authentic spicy food I've ever had around Philly.My family and I came in today for dinner. We ordered 3 dishes at the same time, one of which was Mapo Tofu. We got the 2 dishes except the mapo tofu and thought it would come out later. As we are eating, we tell the waiter that our mapo tofu has not come out yet. We finish eating and the waiter, finally, comes back to tell us it is almost done. We wait some more and decide to tell the waiter to cancel it. The waiter assures us it is almost done and the cook brings out the dish. At this point, we are in a bad mood because we had to wait for it after we finished eating. We tell him we do not want it and to cancel it from our bill. He says it was late because we ordered it late. This made me furious because we ordered everything at the same time. I went back to tell them to stop packing the food because I was not going to take it with me and to take it off my bill. Surprisingly, they did what I asked. The thing that ticked me off the most was how no one apologized to us.The idea of this place sort of being a little like hotpot is great. The flavors that infuse with the meats and fish are really strong and delicious! We did the fish pot (share with 3-4 people) and the spicy pot where you can add anything you want (small but can share with 2-3 people). Our waiter was very helpful in helping us decide what to get because we are new to this place. He made great suggestions, and was very patient with us so he was the man! The slickness can really get to you if you're more into mild stuff... we got medium and it seemed comfortable but the hotness slowly creeped up on our tongues haha. We loved how the dried chili peppers in all of the dishes were adding a great amount of kick but also brings out more flavor and taste to the meats, noodles, and the tripe we got. As spicy as it ended up being, the black herbal grass jelly dessert almost immediately helped calm down the burning sensation! What a plus, especially since the dessert was complimentary and delicious. Would love to return again!I have been there at least 5 times.
If you are celebrating someone's BD or special occasion, get the spicy fish. It's HUGE.
There are three dishes I LOVE 
1) spicy dry pot 
2) spicy chicken feet
3) spicy pork intestine 
This place will provide an authentic Szechuan experience for your day.I'd recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for good, authentic Chinese food in Philadelphia. Some of the reviewers here seem to be commenting that the restaurant too expensive, but I personally found the prices to be fair, especially when you consider that you're supposed to share the dishes with 2-4 people.
The spicy fish on the hot plate is a must-have and the soups are excellent as well.That is definitely horrible, their dinnerware was not cleaned. The lipstick sticked on the spoon, that is so nasty. very unpleasant experience in this shop, please remember to check your spoon or chopstick before you use. I won't be come here again.Overpriced Szechuan fish restaurant! $40+ for a fish that's normally $20 something. Portions are small. Taste is ok but not worth the money.We ordered a fish dish and a few appetizers. The fish doesn't have a fishy smell, which is good for me because I usually don't like fish much. We ordered the spicy fish with some add ons and it was delicious! It is a bit pricey, but definitely sharable with a small group of friends, so it ended up being not too bad price wise.Food was mediocre. Got the ribs with sticky rice which was a little bland. Also, got the spicy fish pot which was good but nothing special..Service was good. There's are better Szechuan places to try than here.. think it's a little overpricedThe service and atmosphere? Great. Price and taste? Not the hugest fan. 
Perhaps it was because we didn't get the signature fish hot pot ($40+ for one fish? Not ideal for the college budget - or even the fresh-out-of-college budget), but the food wasn't particularly impressive. There are a lot of traditional Szechuan restaurants throughout Chinatown, and while the atmosphere might not be as appealing as this place, the prices and authenticity are much more so. The twice-cooked pork was good, don't get me wrong - but for $15, the portion was a little meager. The short rib with flour...not a fan, sorry. Luckily, the service was nice and the atmosphere made it a fun late night place.The fish tastes great but a little bit pricy.  it will be great if they can make the waiting period shorter    I strongly agree that the fish should come with some veggies instead of paying more for few prices of tofu or others.Although it's definitely overpriced, but the food is really great. Great service and quality. If y'all like spicy food y'all should definitely check it out.Food was tasty but VERY oily. My father in law ordered a veggie fried rice and it was very oily and a mapo tofu which had too much salt and was extremely oily! I had the shrimp and broccoli which was excellent! Lots of shrimp! Chicken Kung pow was delicious . Not much appetizers.Ok, I was hesitant to try this place because of reviews that said it was pricy and wasn't worth it. Let me just start the review with, it is worth it. It's BYOB! We came without a reservation on a Saturday night, all the tables were full and they took our number down. We went to a bubba place because the wait time was 20 minutes. Came back and our table was ready for us! We ordered the striped bass with the Sichuan peppercorn sauce at the spiciest spice level. Our waiter gave us a look basically asking us if we were sure. We can handle spice, we are sure. The fish came out in 30 minutes. We weren't expecting to wait that long but we understand cause the fish is grilled.
The fish was amazing!!! It wasn't fishy at all. I asked the waiter which fish to pick and he suggested big mouth bass because it's super tender but I trust striped bass. But sometimes striped bass has the fish taste depending on how the restaurant prepares it. But oh my gooodness was it delicious. The waiter told us that we should come back and try the big mouth bass, but the stripe bass was so good so I don't know if I'm ready for the next level. The sauce was indeed very spicy. But hey, nothing is too much when you got your soju and beer. We also had milk tea to wash that all down so it's all good. They gave us this herbal jelly dessert and that has done well to cut down the spice.
Give this place a try! It's worth it, trust me!Fish is great, and you can choose a lot of ingredients to go with it. I also really loved their eggplant appetizer.Comfortable foods. Si Xiang Qing huai is a must try! Also love the eggplant and pi dan.Stopped in the first time, not much to say-- Friendly staff, perfectly cooked food and  great atmosphere. I ordered a cold dish i think is call cold chicken and it was delicious. Then we ordered a fish pot with cat fish in Cumin flavor. You can choose both the flavor of the dish and the side veggies. The flavor is authentic and it is comparable to the ones in China. The serving size was big for a fare price.  Will def come back in the future with my friends!This place is stingy. For fish pots you have to pay extra for garnishing side veggies, extra $3 bucks for EACH KIND (a few tiny pieces), such as napa cabbage, potato, mushroom. Excuse me??? 
The fish we ordered was the most expensive one - big mouth bass, nearly $80 along with the side veggies. It tasted good but was not enough for two people to share. 
And then the stir fried kidney dish we ordered doesn't require extra $$ for garnishing veggies, but it had only a few small pieces of kidney with a whole bunch of very chewy celery and carrot.Good food but with bad music. The music made me feel uncomfortable when I was eating. The food is good, especially the eggplant. It's the best eggplant I've ever ate!!! Strongly recommend this dish.Came here for Kao Yu, it's not bad, but I personal like their pig feet the best! Looking to try the intestine dish next time!Oh this is one of the best Chinese restaurants in Philly. We went there after 11pm. Waiter and waitress greeted us warmly. I random ordered two dishes 酸菜魚，辣椒炒肉丁 for 1 person as I came from DC and the food portion is rather small here. When the food arrived, my mouth dropped because it was huge. More surprisingly the food was excellent delicious. I love the food and service. Owners, can you open one of your restaurant in DC?This was a very incredible experience for me that I had never had before. This restaurant serves spicy fish hot pot which I was told has become in style in China in recent years. This style of preparing fish house eventually arrived in the United States but most restaurants serve the fish fry is because it is easier to cook that way before dipping it into the sauce that is boiling with vegetables. As I understood it this place is unique because they actually take great care in selecting high-quality ingredients and then grilling them on a charcoal grill. It was reflected in the quality and the taste of the food that we ate. We had striped bass in Szechuan spicy sauce with lotus potatoes cilantro and enoki mushrooms. One thing that's tough is that you may find yourself a sticker shock as a whole fish can start in the neighborhood of $50. However if you come in a group and share the meal and add a number of vegetables to the sauce and you can eat a very filling meal for a low cost per person. The Decorations are very modern and the wait staff was very friendly and attentive. Make sure you take your time to read the menu and understand exactly what it is that you were ordering. The menu does have some fan favorites or some comfort food items that people from the United States maybe more familiar with. Go straight to the fish for that is what this restaurant is known for and take a chance ask some of your neighbors and Ask some of the waiters to help you recommend something that is delicious!Amazing flavors! The fish is HUGE! The scallop was amazingBeen here many times, never had one plate of bad food. I personally think this is the best restaurant in Philly Chinatown.Service is ok.... not very hospitable.  Everything you'd expect from a Chinese restaurant that caters to mostly locals (Chinatown).  
Food was good.  Spicy and nice presentation.  BYOB, but didn't know until i asked.  First server I asked about beer, he simply responded with "No".The food were average. The service was ok as well. What made me really mad is that I spent half hour to pick the peppers from the dish. And then the server DID NOT wrap up the leftovers for me. 
According to Yerkes-Dodson Law, you just can't get it when you want something so bad. "Hate is baggage.Life's too short to be pissed off all the time."Honestly, what kind of restaurant will still open for business while their AC is totally down and they even pretend nothing happens? The room temperature is so high that they have to keep their door open all the way to avoid their customer from heat stroke... this is literally the most ridiculous thing I've ever seen in my entire life. Not to mention their over-priced menu and limited food selection... I've been to similar places in NJ and LA with much better taste and much bigger food portion size. Too bad my girlfriend like this place or I'm gonna give them one star straight for my sauna-like dining experience.Hmmm, I used to come here often.  But after tonite, not sure I would return any time soon.   We ordered the grilled fish w tomato sauce coz one of us cannot eat spicy.   That's a big mistake.  It is A LOT ketch up.  Com'n, for a $50 bucks dish, don't cheap your customer on the sauce pls.  Fish was kinda old and the spam was tastier than the fish.   What else can I say?! 
The dry pot cauliflower was ok.  The shrimp and pineapple fried was tasty.The service was terrible we waited forever for
our food and then had to deal with people smoking while we ate our food. We left not long after waiting forever for our food because it was getting so late.It wasn't anything special AT ALL! Think twice before you go here! Seriously.The portion of food they provide here is extremely small. Three of us ordered $70 worth of food but left a little better than empty stomached. The $50 bucks fish dish is such a scam. Gigantic pot with barely any fishBlah. I only had the fish pot once, and found it to be underwhelming for the price. We came back for some other dishes and weren't too impressed. We ordered the shredded potato, fried fish with garlic powder, and intestines pot. The potatoes weren't bad, the flavor was pretty decent. The fish was meh, we didn't have any real impression of that dish. But the intestines pot dish wasn't really fresh. They had a distinct odor to them, and we eat intestines a lot. Overall, I wouldn't be opposed to coming back and trying some other dishes, but I'm not super eager.We literally watched the waiter place our food on THREE different tables (with a minute wait in between) before the other guests who were picking at the sides realized it was not their order.
After seeing this the waiter picked up the food and served it to us....
We promptly paid our tab and left. The wait staff was not apologetic at all and did not own up to their mistakes. I would not recommend this to anyone.The menu is diverse but not for vegans. Beautiful food. Wonderful service from the gentlemen today. I will return.My friends and I decided to check this place out because we heard about its recent opening. The interior design of this restaurant is very neat and inviting. The staff here are very friendly and attentive to their customers. We decided to begin with one of their appetizers, the Yam with Blueberry and then had our main dish, the Grouper Fish Pot with the Chopped Pepper Flavor. You can pick your own flavor and "add-ons" for your fish pot. Not forgetting, the freedom to select your own choice of fish. It may seem a little expensive to some but the food definitely lives up to its price. Our fish pot was very savory and spicy, but not spicy to the point where you would be chugging glasses of water instantly. There were four of us and one fish pot was sufficient for us. However, if you're really hungry, two people can finish one pot! For a newly opened spot, I have to say they did an excellent job at meeting my expectations and I will definitely be coming back!First the good: 
The atmosphere is upscale for the area and the servers are attentive. The food is exceptionally presented; colorful and very appealing even to the point of suggesting a French Asian fusion in appearance. The menu features mostly animal bi-products: tripe, intestines etc. you should know this going in. According to other reviews they are know "apparently" for their hot pot. I guess it is all the rage in China right now. This did not appeal to me as the menu read like a salad bar of add on ingredients that lacked any guidance. I decided to pass on it as I was unsure what ingredients to choose that would produce a good result... given that I had no idea of what the base broth was.  
The bad news, and it is very bad:
As good as the food looks is in direct proportion to how grossly inedible the dishes are. I chose two dishes that were, to me, safer options. The braised pork and the chicken with scallions. I avoid the more adventurous items on the menu because they did not really appeal to me given the late hour... it was 10:30pm. 
The chicken came out first, and it looked fabulous. Unfortunately it had an overwhelming smelled of boiled chicken as soon as it hit the table. It turns out that the sauce, which WAS interesting and just this side of ACTUALLY being good, was spooned over unseasoned, boiled, chicken breasts. The chicken was only prepare to the extent that it was cut into pieces. The meat itself tasted foul and smelled worse. To insure that this dish was almost inedible the "chef" decided that it would be ok to cut up the chicken with the bones still in place. So with each piece of meat you were picking ¼" bone pieces and bits of skin out of your mouth with your fingers. To get the vibe of what this dish was like to eat; visualizing watching someone else sitting across the table from you creating a pile of partially chewed food matter on the table in front of you. Eating this dish is as nauseating an experience as the taste was.
The second dish makes the first seem great. It was the braised pork.... this was actually my safety dish believe it or not. I mean how can you screw up pork right? Again, the dishes presentation was wonderful; someone has an inspired eye for plating food. Unfortunately they have no affinity for the taste of food. The "pork" was 1/8" sliced fat. In fact, the braising was exclusively on the edge of 1.5" of pure fat. The rest of the "meat" adjacent material looked like it had been boiled.... it was gray and lifeless. Somehow the chef managed to miss every opportunity to make something of the pork. The texture, smell and taste was vile to the point of repulsive; like eating raw fat back/bacon if you managed to to select the piece with virtually no meat to speak of. But it gets better. Somehow, somewhere the thought went through this alleged chef's gastronomic mind that this repast should be served over a bed of ground brown slightly gritty and wholly un-complementary mush like substance; quinoa maybe, I am still not sure even now, what it was that I was served. But In this chefs hubris, in what I can only image was when he was in an inventive mood, this chef choose to saturate this brown "food" like material with the flavor of a pungent stall tea bag. The dish arrives at the table with an overwhelming stench of aromatic tea. On the plus side it killed the smell of the boiled chicken from the first dish. If there is any saving moments for this dish it would be that you are given a mercifully small amount of the pork fat substance; Unfortunate you have about a full cup of the brown bed of tea soaked muck to gag your way through.
My personal experience with the foods palatable nature was validated by the other patrons seated in the restaurant. The other diners were a mix of mostly Asian couples and groups as well as a smattering of "others". I watch as table after table was cleared, noting with much annoyance that most of the food was left untouched. I felt burned and left the restaurant feeling nauseated and my stomach doing "flip flops". This was not an acquired taste... it was just some genuinely bad food.
So, apparently, I managed to find the one restaurant in Chinatown that is truly awful. I spent the time to write this in hopes of sparing other diners this miserable experience. They have no idea what food should/could taste like. Exquisite presentation but totally and completely horrible.
It is official, I got food poisoning.Their food is good but way too pricey. A fish with add ons will cost you around $80 depends on what you want.. the fish itself usually is very small and is btw $30-$60. Love their food and all, but time to time I don't think is worth it anymore.I love this place! The food is great and so is the service. If you love spicy food, this is it! I don't normally eat fish but they don't make it fishy at all! They even give you free jelly dessert to calm the spiciness afterwards.Authentic! Everything was cooked very well and very flavorful. One piece of advice though is that if you are not used to very spicy food, order the level of spice a notch down than you normally would - they are serious about their spice levels!I was surprised by the number of lower ratings for this place honestly. Good food, nice clean interior, and some unique dishes that I haven't seen at other chinese restaurants in the city. 
Menu is HUGE and a bit daunting with all of the rather unique ingredients (Intestines, fungus, feet, pig ears, etc etc). Nice pictures with everything that was relatively accurate to what we got. As others have said the smashed eggplant with preserved egg was excellent and very different. Also had the griddle cooked short ribs which were nice and spicy and cooked very well. We also got some on the hose edamame, pickled veggies, and green tea ice cream which was a nice touch. Service was good and one of the waiters very nicely explained to us how to mash the eggplant and egg ourselves to our desired flavor. 
Honestly, menu was almost TOO big and a bit confusing as to how it was organized which can make it hard for people not familiar with the cuisine to order. Had the cold chili chicken too which was very meh. 2/3 ain't bad though right? 
Will definitely be recommending this place to my more adventurous friends and will try to come back with someone that can guide me through the menu a bit more. Overall a good experience at a very decent price.Pricey but absolutely worth it. I have been here a couple of times either with friends or family it's great for sharing.
Fish hotpot is a must. When I went with a friend we shared the hotpot combo where there's a specific # of options you have to include for a ~$35 hotpot. With family, we go for the stripped bass- there's 3 options on spice level but if you can't handle spice like my brother I recommend getting a garlic base. 
The hotpot itself comes in neat "chest like" pot or moon shaped hanging pot. The interior is very modern and I really like how they have outlets at the seats! Big plus since my phone is always dying. 
The menu is very vast - very, very vast. I'll be coming a couple dozen more times until I get to every dish offered here.What a wonderful place we stumbled upon after our horrible experience at Shiao Lan Kung Restaurant. (See my review on that place). The place was clean, including the restroom, and all the workers there gave great service.  We were attended to immediately. We ordered several dishes and they came out in a timely fashion. I would say they brought out the last of of orders within 20 minutes. We also ordered drinks. The meal was delicious, came out hot and tasted fresh. I would highly recommend this establishment!We tried this because it was new, had an interesting interior and the restaurant we wanted to go to was going to take 45 minutes. We were pleasantly surprised. The menu was a little sparse without any descriptions of the food, but rather a picture. We ordered the signature spicy pot, cumin lamb chops, sticky rice with ribs, and sliced beef and tripe with chili oil. The soup intimidated me with all of the chili peppers but it was very good with a great savory flavor u see the spice. The cumin lamb chops had a bit too much cumin for my taste, but a good deal for $18.99 for 8 lamb chops. Great for sharing. The rice and ribs were also really good. Soft and tender, a good break from the spicy stuff. The beef and tripe was also delicious and had a layer of fresh noodles veggies under to balance the heat.I gave them a shot during the lockdown to have some takeout. Taste was great but the portion was too small. The photo is "cold pot fish" for which they charged $30. Turned out after picking ~12 small pieces of fish all left was some mashed unrecognizable spices.At least I used it to cook $3 worth of raw fish and got twice as much of fish!When you walk into a chinese restaurant and it's full of only a bunch of young chinese people, it's a pretty good sign you can just look at their tables and go for the same dishes. And walking into Xun Yu Si Kao, from the moment the smells hit to seeing all the dishes come out, we knew we'd be in for a good dinner. Once you open up the menu you'll be pleasantly surprised by how all the dishes have pictures, and while the initial lay out of the menu may not be super intuitive, it is nice to just point at what looks good and ask your server for that. We opted for their signature fish pot, along with stir fry intestines and ma po tofu. The intestines were some of the best I've had; great texture and savory and spicy sauce made me crave more with each bite.
Shallow Fish pot is a little bit pricey but ultimately delicious; your starting fish are $40 but you add veggies and carbs to it so that it bathes in the sauce and gives you a savory, spicy, altogether tasty combo that you will want spooning over your rice for days. As a default, just go ahead and order the $5 veggie combo(with enoki, seaweed, and sliced potatoes), and then throw in whatever else makes you happy. We liked glass noodles, black fungus, but you can really customize as you wish. Everything is cooked nicely and the grill they serve it on keeps everything nice and warm throughout your dinner; the sauce is delicious enough that we packed it home afterwards just to throw in more vegetables and replicate the meal the next day. 
Overall, a bit pricier than most Chinatown establishments, but the quality is worth it, the place is clean, and they also do a surprisingly good job with the presentation of their dishes. If you can handle the spice, you'll be in for a good time if you stop by here to eat.Dont let the menu intimidate you! This is one of the best places that I've been to in a while. Comforting and relaxing environment. It's almost a cozy feeling being in there while being surrounded by delicious food. The food was definitely worth the price. It's super filling and is made for more than one person.. which is why I completely understand why the prices are the way they are.
I love how the fish pots are customizable and there's so many different spices and fish to chose from. I love that you're not limited to just one. 
Our meal consisted of Bass covered with ginger with an addition of spam, hand drawn noodles, and potato.
The bass as super tender and moist. It was perfectly cooked! No complaints :)
At first, my fiancee thought the spam would be a weird combo with the fish but the soup that was incorporated into the fish, gave the spam a really nice and soft flavor. This was a huge surprise because, as most people know, spam usually has this distinct taste about it. However, when it was incorporated into the dish, thr taste was completely altered for better!
As for the hand drawn noodle, they were kind of stacked on top each other and was really hard to grab with the chop sticks because of the oil and the weight of the noodle. The hand drawn noodles would probably be my least favorite... only because it was really tough to eat and it didn't really have any flavor to it.. even though it was submerged in the soup.
As for the potato.. well it's a potato lol. That's it. It didn't really take on any flavors.
Aside from the food, the waitors were really helpful with picking out what kind of fish we should try. They weren't biased on a certain type of food either. They recommended what we would enjoy as individuals. They also weren't rude or pushy like certain restaurants around China town. They actually have a very polite demeanor about them. It's one of the best services that I've experienced so far in China town.. and we're regulars in a lot of places. 
TL;DR
If you're a seafood person or even a person who likes spices, I would definitely give this place a try. You will not be disappointed :D.Roast fish tasted very good, delicious beans in garlic sauce. Awesome appetizers and complimentary grass jelly for dessert.
Tip: choose sea bass over flounder.Food: Three words: authentic, delicious, fulfilling. We got their MaLa (Spicy Peppercorn) flavor Catfish Fish-Pot with add-ons. Although this restaurant is definitely more expensive than your local eats, it is worth the experience and affordable to share with friends. Their MaLa flavor is genuine in that it doesn't taste like the instant hot-pot MaLa paste. There's plenty of peppercorn to give your mouth a numb, tingling sensation. The catfish was fried crispy on the outside edges, and yet tender on the inside. One order comes with 2-3 servings of rice, however additional servings/refills cost $2 each, which is the same price per add-ons. Pickled radish/edamame are served as side dishes.
Service: The service wasn't on par with the food's excellence. The servers were impatient and submissive upon placing orders and refused to give us proper seatings upon request considering it was not a busy night. 
Atmosphere: The interior is beautiful and clean. Seatings offer booth or chair-table sets, with the back reserved for larger parties.Pretty good food and a vibrant atmosphere, which matches downtown Philly in general.
We came here with a college student from China now studying in Philly and she did all the ordering. 
My mom and her husband were amused by the new dishes and their Chinese names the kids order these days. I guess hipsterism knows no geographical bounds. Nice to know there exists progressive Chinese food, though.
We had the griddle cooked intestines which was the highlight of the meal and my day - definitely beat being a tourist on the UPenn campus. When done right, Sichuan mala numbing spicy taste is amazing. This place got it right. Also while greasy, it wasn't as bad as most Sichuan restaurants. Like a level down from that. Very spicy but delicious.
Fatty beef with pickled peppers was not bad. It reminded me of a hot pot with fatty beef. The soup was rich and tasty with tasty vermicelli noodles at the bottom.  The downside was a slight chemical after taste. I felt like this restaurant made cool progress and innovation for Chinese food but adding unnecessary stuff to a good dish just shoots yourself in the foot. Also I don't know how I feel about the sweet and sour flavor.
Stir fried cabbage was amazing. A very simple dish but just the right amount of salt and pepper, garlic and ginger and cooking technique made it great.
We also had the spicy pot with sliced fish. Pretty good quality fish and slightly less greasy than traditional Sichuan fish in chili oil.
Price was amazing considering how much we ate and had leftover. It bumped it from a 4.5 to a 5 Yelp stars place for me.
Overall a very good meal and I'm happy to see they also have a branch in Brooklyn.Loved the smell when walking into the restaurant. We had a veggie and pork intestines on hot pot. Very good flavor. Service is great too.Came here and decided to try the grilled
Fish with spicy flavor and ordered mushrooms and tofu as toppings. Also ordered couple of appetizers. Tofu century egg, roast pork knuckle, and fuqi fai pian. Flavor was just ok. Decent 3 star for Philly. Could work on the quality a bit more.Me and my family was looking for a new spot to eat in Chinatown instead of regular pho or dim sum. My brother suggest Xun Yu Si Kao. XYSK is located between Cherry and Race on 10th street. Just a few stores down from Tea Do or across from Vivi's. 
When we entered the establishment, we were greeted and seated immediately. We've ordered shrimp with broccoli lunch special and Hot pots with assortments of toppings. I don't remember everything we've added but toppings like enoki mushrooms, quail eggs, tofu skin, lotus, taro, mini sausage, braised beef, etc.....
When our waiter brought our Hot pot, I was surprised. The hot pot looks very extraordinary, I've never seen anything like it. Very nice and expensive looking. I was looking from the top to the bottom, from side to side lol. I can't help it:)
Food wise. Hubby love the Shrimp with broccoli. He says everything taste so freaking fresh, from the entree to the rice, soooo good. Me, my mom, and my brother were digging through the hot pot for our favorite add ons. We empty everything on the table, it was that good. Herbal jelly were given to us as complimentary desserts, definitely a plus.Always passed by this but never ventured in as there are so many options in Chinatown. My friend suggested this place and we came on a Saturday night for dinner. It was a bit busy but we were seated quick and they gave us small appetizers (pickled radish and edamame). We ordered a fish pot (bass) with sauerkraut and a spicy meat appetizer. The food was good but I felt like the fish was a bit bland since I had the appetizer first which was spicy. I was hoping that they gave us more sauerkraut but there wasn't much. Don't expect much service here. The waiter only came to take our order, bring our food and rushed us by bringing us the check while we were still eating (there were not that many customers). Keep in mind that it can get a bit expensive as these two dishes were over $70.A pricy hot pot that centers around oven roasted fish.
You select a fish and soup base ranging in price between $30 to $60 and then select toppings that cost $2-4 each.  When i went they were out of the more moderately priced half fish that would make more sense for the two of us. We went with a $40 sea bass and the black bean sauce which is a tiny bit spicy with a pepper corn spice burn to it. We added some tofu skin, seaweed knots, and lotus root.
The fish comes out in a huge cast iron pan with smoldering charcoal beneath so prepare for it to be hot and somewhat spicy.
All in all i enjoyed it. I wish it were a better moderately priced as the sea bass wasn't that big. My gf and i were super full but i would recommend either a lot of add ins or two fish if you have 3 or 4 people with healthy appetites.A huge variety of Chinese food that all taste consistently delicious! I've been here twice, and both times, everyone in my party enjoyed the food. There's something for everyone in their large menu, though most of the food will have a bit of a kick. This most recent time I came, I'm glad there were seats on a Friday night, though they were pretty busy! We thoroughly enjoyed the cold dish Thousand Year Old Eggs with Tofu, Stir Fried Green Beans (has pork), Dry Pot Intestines, and Honey Fried Rice Cakes.  The honey fried rice cakes is a great accompaniment to the spicy dishes, at least to my weird taste buds that enjoy sweet and savory dishes. They end the meal with a complimentary sweet grass jelly dessert that perfectly wraps everything up.Came with my parents after hearing good things, and ordered a bunch! My favorite things were the spicy numbing dry pot, along with the sticky rice filled lotus. We also ordered a red chili oil conch appetizer, and a fish. My parents swore they gave us a tilapia instead of the bass, but I have no idea! The food was all spicy and flavorful, and the dish decor was very fancy.This is definitely a foodie spot for spicy food lovers. Although you can select the spicy level to your dishes, it probably will taste better with a little kick. Their taste is Sichuan style which is known for having tons of red peppers on the dishes. 
They serve a whole fish (with many selection) on a cast iron plate so it's perfect for sharing. With the fish you can add toppings such as vegetables and meat to enhance the flavor. Also, you will be able to select the spice flavors such as garlic, cumin, tomato, mixed peppers, etc. They serve it with white rice but is only restricted to 2 bowls per entree. Additional bowl is extra. 
Overall, the restaurant is somewhat aesthetic which mean you can take photos with your friends in front of a nice background at some spots and it's got a authentic wooden vibe. And also clean!The food is good but make sure to double-check the receipt when you pay at the end. If not, you may be paying for ingredients that is not included in the food. I tried the fish pot here about 3-4 times and spicy pot once.... almost every time they are missing something such as white radish, enoki mushroom, crabmeat, konjac cake ties, and etc. However, all the ingredients that I ordered was charged including the missing ones. I also ordered a spicy pot for pick-up today and they miss ingredients again.Hmmm I'm not a fan, my colleague and I decided to try this spot, they have a great interior design! The menu was great but what we wanted for appetizer wasn't available ("We don't sell that anymore", but didn't the store just open?) anyway, we were going to try the fish but we were out of time, so we opted for lunch specials anyway, not good. The general tsos was not crispy at all.. bland.. service was ok.. Probably will try again to try the fish this timeWe got the peppercorn Sichuan fish pot with striped bass, and added lotus, cabbage, and enoki mushroom.. The broth was filled with 90% peppers and it was amazing. I would definitely recommend adding vegetables to the fish pot. The fish was perfectly cooked, extremely tender. The vegetables pick up the broth flavor very well and add a great texture and crunch. 
We also got the chinese yam with blueberry appetizer. It was good but quite heavy for an app.
Definitely recommend this place!Perfect dinner! This is a hidden gem in Philly's Chinatown - quick service, amazing food, and great atmosphere. Totally worth the price. Come with a large group for the famous fish pot!!! The Pork Belly dish is also fabulous.Really awesome hotpot place! They had a TON of different options for customized dry pot, whole fish pots, and multitudes of options for authentic Chinese cuisine They even offer Americanized dishes, but what clearly shines is their various options for hot pot. 
We only got a customizable pot but were able to fill it with everything we wanted. Their add-ins have attached prices and you have to hit a $30 minimum. We hit just around there and were both pretty satisfied; they also offer bowls of rice! You can also adjust the spice level to your liking; we got 2/3 for enough Szechuan kick but enough were you can taste the food. Our favorite picks were the scallops and king oyster mushroom.
We'll definitely be back to try the hanging pork belly and the whole fish pot!We got the Szechuan numbing spicy fish stew, I think it was just called spicy fish pot on the menu. It was bursting with flavor and so spicy. Would give it 7 out if 10  for spiciness. It's like a pre-prepared hot pot with shiitake mushroom, cabbage, and other veggies in addition to the fish. Definitely enough for two people, with enough leftovers for two kore meals. Loved the flavors and indoor seating was also nice.I stumbled in here one evening when the wait at chubby cattle was too ridiculous to be bothered, and boy was I glad I did! Their bass fish pot was amazinnnngg! The Szechuan flavors really hit the spot for me. We also got their pork belly and mayo tofu. 4 stars for their food and 5 stars for their presentation! I'll definitely be coming back to try their other menu items.Amazing food. had a bit of a diner vibe that made it very comfortable to be. I've heard their soups are good but we made a simple dry pot and it was so good! I loved being able to choose what was in it. Plus their iced tea is the best tea I've had in a long time. We are definitely coming back.One of the few restaurants where my head kept turning all directions at other people's dishes that they ordered. Those around us probably thought we were staring them down but no! We were staring down their dish! 
**ATMOSPHERE**
Very nice restaurant, not like some of the ones around in Chinatown. This restaurant is very trendy looking and doesn't look like those typical tacky Chinese restaurants, so pictures are very much great in this place! They have seats big enough for large groups up the ramp so don't worry there's plenty of room, but I can sense this place becoming popular really quickly!
**SERVICE**
Service was fast and they didn't rush us so that was good. We were pretty indecisive since there were so many things to choose from! Everytime we turned we saw a new dish that was amazing looking! Psst!!! They all look photogenic too so photo opportunities are everywhere!!! Also if you are waiting around to get seated they do offer those buzzers so as long as you are within the proximity you can do other stuff while you wait. We ended up going across the street to Vivi Bubble Tea and grabbed a quick drink and sat and chatted and the buzzer let us know when to go. They also don't seem to have a problem with us bringing in bubble tea to their restaurant so we were pretty happy not to waste our drinks!
**FOOD**
Food was amazing! If you love spicy this is definitely the place for you, but even if you don't like spicy foods they have a good variety of food that you can choose that aren't spicy. For the fish dish you could combine flavors (they have flavors to choose from) so we combined garlic and spicy to create a slightly spicy garlic-y flavor that worked well for us since we had members in our group that couldn't take that much spice. We also ordered the pork belly (cold dish) that was pretty average, but the sauce that came with it was the winner of the entire dish. 
**TIP**
Fish dishes are large so make sure you're either ready to gobble the whole thing down OR come in a group of 2-4 people. We were a group of 4 girls, 1 guy and the 1 sea bass dish was good enough for us. We added a couple of side dishes into the fish dish that definitely added more to our stomachs. 
Overall this place is a must go if you love Asian food! It's one of the only Szechuan restaurants in the city and tastes pretty authentic if you want Chinese food. We definitely love this place and would recommend this to anyone in the area!
