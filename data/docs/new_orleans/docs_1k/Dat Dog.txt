Thanks Raymond for taking care of us tonight. 
Great customer service. You deserve a medal for understanding our wants & needs.Great courtyard and better food and service. It's a great change of pace from the more congested and louder parts of the city. I've had the crawfish dog on all my visits and look forward to coming back next time I'm in town.This is my all time favorite hotdog place ever. It caters to not only meat eaters but also vegetarians and vegans. They have amazing fries, and they always make sure that they get your order correct. The service is great, and the workers are always extremely nice. The process is pretty quick for the most part, and they offer indoor and outdoor seating. If you're looking for a hotdog, I would 100% recommend this place.Great hot dogs with a good variety of sausages and toppings. We had the crayfish dog and the seadog (cod), both delicious. It has nice outdoors sitting where you can enjoy your meal and a beer while watching some football.I loved this place! 
I'm vegan and Dat Dog came as a recommendation from a friend. They have several Field Roast vegan dog options, which is awesome. I buy field roast brand for making meals at home (the best vegan sausages in my opinion) so I chose my favorite, Apple Sage. (For vegans out there: Italian is also good, I don't think Chipotle is good at all, even though I tend to like Chipotle-flavoring generally).
I love that they have tons of options to add-on to the hot dogs. I got grilled onions, creole mustard, and sweet relish. I especially loved the Creole mustard. The bun was so soft and lightly toasted and this dinner really hit the spot. Their fries are very tasty too! Get them with a side of the Creole mustard. I also got a punch from the bar which was delicious.
What I loved the most about Dat Dog was the ambience. They play fantastic music, and it's a chill fun vibe. I sat in the outdoor area with beautiful lights and picnic tables. Perfect for a summer night.There is absolutely nothing healthy on the menu, and it is wonderful. 
Describing Dat Dog as a "hot dog place" does not do it justice. You arent getting some super-processed weenie on a bun. There's tons of sausages to choose from: smoked Cajun sausage, bratwurst, duck sausage, crawfish saussage, alligator... even multiple vegetarian options! My favorite is the spicy chipotle veggie dog, because Im not big on meat, but I had a bite of my boyfriend's alligator dog and it was great too..but seriously, spicy chipotle veggie dog. The best. I greatly dislike plain white bread (because Im annoying), so I was really suspicious of what kind of bun I would get at first. But the bun is awesome too! Its some type of sourdough I think, and its soft & chewy but grilled and perfect. You get as many toppings as you want on your dog, and they have too many to list - everything up to crawfish etoufee to guac. 
The fries. MMMMM. So crispy and perfect and good. I like em plain, but they also have some etoufee fries that are amazing. Sometimes I just skip the dog and make an ensemble of fries with  a ton of toppings - you can customize a fries order with any combo of toppings available for dogs if you like. My recommendation: guac, pico, cheddar cheese & jalapeno. Like nachos but with fries. Let that sink in for a minute. 
You order at a kitchen window in the back of the restaurant and they bring your order out to you. They have a bar that is situated so that it is half inside and half outside, making it easy to get drinks. My only complaint about Dat Dog is that they staff the bar really light... it can take forever to get a served because they have 1 or 2 bartenders for everyone in the restaurant (as there isnt table service). Decent variety of beer and they have some specialty cocktails, but Im more of a beer person so I havent tried them. 
The outside patio is lovely, its one of my favorite places to go on a pretty day. They also have trivia (I think on Wednesdays), Ive been a few times and trivia night is really fun.We drove two hours just to eat here again for Father's Day.   The service was just as good the second time around.  Nick took our order and was so helpful!   My husband and kids love hot dogs so this is by far their favorite place to eat.  I don't normally eat hot dogs but Dat Dogs has changed that for me.  I eat the Duck Special.  It's a turducken dog with a blackberry compote on top. Omg, yummy!   I have never driven two hours to eat anywhere but have for Dat dogs.   We will definitely be back soon!!Best fucking hot dogs for late night munchies. I had the alligator with sauerkraut and ketchup it was great. My wife had the Bacon Werewolf and I had food envy! The buns were crispy, sweet and the perfect match for the dogs! The dogs were crispy, meaty, and packed a ton of flavor!! Highly recommend even if you're sober! If your a hot dog enthusiast you cannot skip Dat Dog!I would happily eat here every day of my life. I went with a large group (10 people) that included a vegetarian, some very picky eaters and some food snobs (myself included) and we all found something we absolutely loved. Not one of us had a bad review of our food. I had the Dat Chick and that bacon cheddar ranch fries. Both were to die for. I love the large menu and the laid back atomsphere. Plus the staff was super nice and accommodating considering we were asking lots of questions and had so many orders. The only downside is that there isn't one in Miami!Alligator sausage with crawfish etoufee, guacamole, and creole mustard? Only at Dat Dog will you try this awesome concoction. The combinations are endless!Bread on the dog is so good. Really that's the only thing that stood out. I had the crawfish etoufee which was ok.The kitchen staff made excellent suggestions.  Asked what I thought looked interesting and then recommended a dog that I LOVED!!  Cool vibe, great food!  The bacon ranch fries were awesome!!Had to stop by here after reading about all of the different sausages and fry toppings. I got the etoufee fries, which are delicious. If anything, I should've asked to double that etoufee because one can never have enough. Paired that with a margarita and I was one happy lady. The BF got the alligator sausage and wasn't able to choose what toppings, so he asked that they choose for him. He was very happy. The service here was really great, super nice people and lots of seating. It's definitely a fun place for lunch.Came in for lunch at Dat dog on a Monday and it was quite busy.  Atmosphere was great as was food and beer selectionI don't understand this location and I don't know why I keep coming back. The food is good like the other locations. My main problem is the bar service. It is the same blonde girl with the nose ring (Kathleen) that ruins every time we come. She obviously doesn't want to work. She actively avoids the customers at the bar. She walks around looking down at the ground and at the bottles but not the customers. There was also another guy with a beard, glasses and man bun. He's not much better. It took us 10 minutes to order our drinks and another 15 to close out our bill. I'd be very interested to see what it's like here when there are more than 10 people at the bar. I'm going to stick with the Freret location.Here with my family. We got a bunch of Dat Dogs. We went Dat crazy!!! The cheddar bacon ranch fries were unbelievable. I thought the étouffée dog was the best until I had the Dat Chic and Dat Burger. Phenomenal!!! Then we had the Duck Special...even better!!! Crazy good! Smokey and sweet and full of flavor. I'm about to try the gator dog if my nephew will let me have a bite :) FYI...have a Dat Beer. Hoppy IPA. Very, very good.Good hot dogs, polite staff. 4 stars because it took almost 10 minutes to get my hot dog. The place has a bar right when you enter and also a big backyard with big seating area. Selection of hot dogs is pretty good especially if you like seafood. Prices are reasonable.This is for the new Dat Dog on Magazine. It's as good as the original on Freret, but I prefer the decor in the other one. The Magazine location has a bigger outdoor area, with a bar that's combo inside/outside bar. It would be nice if they had heat lamps outside for when it's cold outside, but that's not a big deal because it doesn't often get really cold.
The people working are great and went out of their way to accommodate us when we had a large group of 8. Also, they put Grumpy Cat on their tip jar. That alone is worth an extra star.Great hot dogs, okay fries. We were walking down Magazine Street, and we were starving. Dat Dog's really hit the spot. There is lots of outdoor seating on tables and benches, so this is a great place for a group to eat, drink, and relax.It is funny to me that designer hot dog places are growing in scope and popularity. It is the main thing on the menu here and it is not that bad. I am sure you can get a regular hot dog, but they are known for their specialty dogs that come on a variety of flavors, toppings, etc. Anything you can imagine in or on a hot dog, you can get it here. They also serve a lot of beer and have trivia night on Wednesday nights. 
Place was fine and fun, but still just hot dogs and fries dressed up for fun.I can go and on about how great Dat Dog is. Service can sometimes be a little slow, but the amazing dogs and fries make up for it. Anything from the slovenian dog to the crawfish dog is incredibly delicious, and there aren't many places outside of NOLA that have food as unique as this. My personal favorite sausage that you can't go wrong with is the gator sausage. Also, I recommend ordering them chef's choice because they always think of some unique and delicious combination of toppings that go with the actual dog. Fries wise, I'd go with the bacon cheddar ranch or the white trash fries. This place is also very cheap and fun so bring along people visiting you from out of town because everyone loves it!First time, food was great. The dogs are pretty massive and filling, wife and i split one and an order of fries. This is the "pinks" of New Orleans. Ordered the werewolf, its was good, i dont see why its a fav, nothing spectacular about it. The bacon cheesy fries were better than the dog. The bun is great, but too big, it over powers the dog. Outdoor sitting was great. Will return to try another dog, the Guiness Dog sounded great.Great food. Beer is expensive though. I love that there are changing tables in both the men's and women's restrooms.The toppings variety was great! I just wish the veggie dog was like an actual dog and not a veggie burger sliced in half. I liked being there tho!This place was pretty good; great ambiance, location (had to check out Frenchmen!), and good beer selection!
Loved the variety of dogs available, and it was perfect because we had a vegan friend with us and she had plenty of options too.  She got the Spicy Chipotle Veggie dog with vegan toppings (yum!), my other friend got the Apple Sage (vegan) dog, and I went for the crawfish sausage (when in NOLA....) which I really enjoyed since it wasn't too crawfishy, but you could definitely taste it, though still had the texture of a sausage.  I would have wanted to try to loaded fries, but we had TACHOS on the mind for next door-- so we skipped that.
All in all, I would definitely recommend this place, as all the options appear to be delicious.  However, in the end, you're paying $8 for a hot dog.  But this would really hit the spot after some bar crawling on the block.This was by far the MOST AMAZING HOT DOG EVER!!!!!! The creole mustard is amazeballs! I got the standard beef hot dog and for it being a standard hot dog, it was still the best ever. I really didn't go too wild with just chili, cheese, onion and mustard. But you can tell that the chili is home made and the bun melts in your mouth like buttah! My hubby was a bit more daring with alligator dog and let the chef go wild, and wild the chef went. We both were oogling over the deliciousness that was in our mouths. Also make sure you try the chili cheese fries, just do it because if you're visiting NOLA, you're here for the atmosphere and the food; so splurge darn it!! You won't regret it!!!A great hotdog place to grab a bite.  All the dogs we tried were delicious.  The Saint was my favorite. It has a nice heat and aftertaste.  I can't wait to come back here again.  My only complaint is that they were out of all the ice cream flavors so no shakes, or root beer floats.   They were also out of the ginger soda.  I'd definitely come here again and if you are looking for a satisfying, quick bite you should too.Bacon werewolf, poppy tookem fries. The dog was delicious and the fries were very good. Will definitely come back here. The atmosphere is boisterous, enjoyable.I never had a hot dog done like this before. I had the étouffée hot dog it was crawfish sausage topped with étouffée and toppings of your choice. There's an option on the menu that says if you can't decide from the list of toppings then you can do chefs choice and they load it for you. I chose that option and it came dressed with like a cold slaw type mixture that added more flavor to the already delicious hotdog. I also ordered the cheese fries that were pretty good too they tasted like the fries that rally's makes really crispy and well seasoned it was a great addition to the dog. 
     I sat at the bar and ordered a few drinks the bartender was really cool recommended the special drinks they were good not very strong but they tasted good. This place is worth a visit if you are in new orleans on vacation or even if you live here and are just looking for another spot to frequent.Food is fun and the atmosphere is great. Everything takes forever. I ordered one hotdog and a side of fries and waited 35 minutes for my order. Asked about it twice and got very ambiguous responses. Food was cold on arrival. I just got a shrug when I asked about it. I really wanted to love this place, but I do not think I'll be returning.Yummy! If you're into hot dogs or sausages, then you might consider this place heaven. 
With an assortment of sausages and toppings, it can be very difficult to put together flavors that work together. In usual fashion, I had our server help me with the toppings. 
I tried the crawfish, alligator and turducken sausages. My server made the selections for the toppings which made each creation uniquely flavorful.
I loved this place. One of the many reasons to come to New Orleans.This place is super cool and laid back. The food and  service was amazing!!! The bartender (Tyler) was very personable and attentive. He gave us a few suggestions on must try local spots. We will definitely be back!!!!I had wanted to try Dat Dog for a long time. What a disappointment. It was nearly empty at 12:30 on a weekday. Kept it simple for my first try and ordered the smoked brat with chili, cheese and onions. That plus fries and a drink came to $13+ after tax, which is ridiculous. The brat was burned and the chili was a cold, putrid glob of muck that had to come from a can. I actually felt insulted. If you can get past the name, Dreamy Weenies on Rampart is 100x better than this garbage.Very cool place with an interesting variety on dogs. A little pricey for the portion size (you probably need 2 dogs if you're really hungry) but it's worth it.  A good lunch and drink pit stop on Magazine.Ths is the first Dat Dog that I went to...I tried the crawfish eutofee dog which was pretty good.  The second time I went, the sausage was slightly overdone.  Somewhat expensive for a hotdog but good for going once to try.Dat Dog is a fun spot for drinks or a high end Hot Dog or Brat of your choosing. Almost an endless selection of condiments and add ons for your dog as well as specialty dogs for the season or a holiday.  Their fries are amazing and come plain or topped with Cheddar or chilli or both. 
Out door seating availability for those that bring their own Dog while they eat their hotdog. The establishment is very open air and TVs are on if you want to catch the game. 
Oh, leave a tip in the jar and see what happens. 
Finally....kinda pricey, it's easy to spend 30 bucks for 2 with drinks fries and tip.Dog, why get rid of the Asian slaw?!    Would have been nice to hear the Saints game not some random music in the background. Otherwise, food =ahmazing.Solid hot dogs - with a variety of options available. We had the smoked sausage with creole mustard as well as the alligator sausage with creole mustard and onions. The buns were delicious - definitely perfect for these types of "dogs." My fiancé and I attempted to consume the crawfish étouffée dog as well - the crawfish sausage was too intriguing not to try. It was so flavorful and tasted just we had hoped it would. The other two dogs were just too big for us to finish the third! I'd go back to this place anytime - great price, solid food, awesome ambiance.We stopped in after checking out the art market outside on a Sunday. Tried the crawfish etouffee dog. Unusual and very flavorful. Just be sure to grab plenty of napkins - it's messy!I went in here earlier and had the crawfish sausage hot dog and it really tasted great for being a loaded-up hot dog for $7.75.  The staff was friendly and they did a "Tip, tip, hooray!" when I left a tip, so that was definitely an added bonus.  I would return in the future to this Dat Dog!I've been a fan of Dat Dog since its humble beginnings, which is why I was so bitterly disappointed by my first meal on Magazine.
The buns dwarf the dogs to a transparently cost-cutting extent, and are so sugary that the aftertaste is unpleasant. The dog itself was still so great I just ended up eating the last bites without the bun. $7.50 for a 78% sugar bun is not appealing.
Sad to say, but I most likely won't eat another Dat Dog.Had the duck special here which was amazing. Would definitely get it again if it's available. This place is within walking distance of my house, which is great, and I adore the decor and the outdoor seating. Haven't been to the one uptown, so I can't compare, but if you're in the Irish Channel and in the mood for a great, albeit very heavy, meal, I definitely recommend this place.Delicious food! Outside eating area was super clean, surprisinlyg clean especially for an outdoor New Orleans eatery! Staff goes the extra mile. Yummy fries!Tons of unique hot dogs! I was super skeptical when my sister said she wanted to take me to a hot dog place, but I was blown away by the amount of options besides just a plain hot dog. I really wanted the Alligator dog, but they were out, so I settled for the Crawfish and it was DELICIOUS. I went simple and just got cheese and pico on top. Definitely get a side of the fries! I will definitely be back to try out the alligator! 
They had a large selection of both local and regional beers, which was awesome for an out-of-towner like myself. They also brew their own beer, which was quite tastey!Dat Dog has got to be the best hot dog joint EVER!!!! From the dozens of topping, literally, that you can choose from!!!!! It's a good thing I live across the lake or I'd be there on a regular basis......Stopped by Dat Dog on a food tour of Magazine Street so this is a limited review.  Tried the Alligator dog and a couple of their flavored sodas and all I can say is...YUM!!!  Next time we are in NOLA we will stop for the full meal deal.  Super cute colorful and festive decor.  Look it up!I love Dat Dog.  New food truck at Tulane is clutch. Always go chefs choice...they know what they're doing. Also gator dog is probably the best, but all of them are tasty. I will always be a fan!Finally made it to the Magazine location.  Big fan of the one on Freret, and the Magazine location didn't disappoint.  Same overall concept, with the bright colors (Simon gone wild) and emphasis on out door seating, but the inside is much larger than the Freret location.
Best hot dogs (they actually has many different kinds of meats in tube form...not just dogs) in the city, with you selecting the type of dog you want and then the condiments.  Great selection of both so you can go many times and always get something different.  I love their fries and get the Poppy Tooker each time.  There is also a full bar and a decent selection of beers.
You order and then take a seat.  When your order is ready they scream your name to find you...so be creative!  Go get a hot dog (and fries)...you will be glad you did!This place was better than the famous Pinks Hot dogs in Hollywood. Love their toppings and the different dogs they had.It could have been that my group just lucked out and chose winning combinations, but we were three for three. You also can't go wrong with the white trash fries. What probably sets this place apart from other hot dog joints I've tried is the bun. Really, we all agreed that the bun may have been what made these dogs great.Amazing hot dogs with a ton of topping choices! I love how you can out as many toppings as you want with no extra charge. 
I ordered the crawfish étouffée dog while my boyfriend got the sea dog with an array of toppings. Personally I didn't like the spices in the creole mustard, but all the other topping mixed well. 
The fries are seasoned really well, I could eat them plain (and I usually drench my fries in ketchup!). The white trash fries are basically chili cheese fries with sour cream, guacamole, and jalapeños.On our hop on hop off bus tour, we decided to stop by Dat Dog to try some specialty hot dogs.  The outside looks very colorful, fun, and inviting.  We tried the crawfish sausage, alligator sausage, and duck sausage.  We were overwhelmed with the variety of condiments..so we had our trusty bartender pick the condiments for us.  They were all absolutely delicious.  The craw fish was my favorite.    The dogs are about $7.75 each, a little pricey but the portions are pretty big and the condiment varieties makes up for it.Great unqunie place to get to get a hot dog in NOLA. You are sure to find something different at this place. Great food/Great vibes.This gourmet hot dog shop was a perfect treat on a rainy Saturday. Unfortunately the art market we wanted to go to was canceled because of the weather, but the food made up for it. The price is a bit steep for those who don't like a bunch of toppings and the wait was a bit long for how quiet the restaurant was, but the food was great. There are a lot of choices when it comes to your meal so make sure to take in the menu before you visit so you're not completely overwhelmed while trying to order. Overall this was a good experience at a unique New Orleans restaurant and I will definitely be returning!I paid for it so I ate it. Does not work as an NYC type of hot dog (the carts are much better) or as a "gourmet"hot dog. 
As an added bonus it was cold.Dat Dog is awesome! I've been to hot dog places throughout the country and Dat Dog is truly one of a kind. If you pass by and even consider this place is an option to eat the answer is YES without any hesitancy.First I want to state I'm not a hot dog fan so rather than my initial 3 I'm giving Datdog a 4 due to the fact I had no real expectations to go off of. I had got the Guinness Dog which I first thought was a hot dog and not a sausage. In turn it was a large sausage lol. It wasn't bad but It wasn't for me. The rest of my party enjoyed theirs for the most part. The overall rating I'm giving is based off the cool atmosphere and the fact the dude at the register tolerated my corny jokes lol. Cool spot overall in your into beer n dogs.Not too shabby although the place was empty. The hot dogs is yummy with the shakes! I will be coming back for some moreGreat hotdog/sausage place with a fun relaxed atmosphere and good customer service both at the counter and in the restaurant. First time in Nola and first time exploring the area. This place seemed like a great spot to try for lunch.
I ordered crawfish sausage and bacon ranch fries. Fries were ok, good but nothing special. The sausage was amazing, never had anything like it. My colleague had a alligator sausage and said it was also good. 
Worth a visit!Yeah sorry, wasnt impressed. Not serving alcohol yet, no menus, hotdog was pretty small, fries came out 7mins AFTER i finished my hotdog, pomme frite fries were flavorless and almost choked on a wad of parsley. 45 mins later I was home and experiencing stomach pains. I suspect it was the fries. they tasted odd.Walking down Magazine and were entranced by the vibrant colors and joyous noise pouring outside from within. We were not really hungry but couldn't' resist the opportunity to try a Dat Dog. We ordered a Chicago Style Dog and coming from Illinois this hot diggity dog is sign, sealed and deserves to delivered as a Chicago style dog. It was so good, we thought about ordering another one, but decided to just vow to come back again. I used to despite hot dogs/hot sausge, anything that came in a link form, after reading Upton Sinclaire's The Jungle, but this place brought me back to my senses.The place wasn't packed but there was a regular flow of patrons... I got a seat on the bar in the open "courtyard" .. In the weather, it was a beautiful setting.. I am unable to name the two glasses of beer that I enjoyed, but one of them was distinctly sweet and very light on the palate..second one was a dark beer, flavorful and tangy..
I ordered the crawfish sausage hot dog and their standard fries... Great combination of mustard sauce, onions and tomatoes on the hot dog, found the fries a little soft for my liking but overall they were better than the usual fare you find at stock places.. I felt they were a bit overpriced considering the fact that the rest of the menu was actually priced very well...
Thoroughly enjoyed an easy afternoon, look forward to another trip before I head back home to the land of road side hot dogs aka NYC .  :-) will miss dat dog for sure...Not impressed by the selection. The weiner, sausage, hot dog- whatever you choose- is a great foundation for a delicious food. But sometimes, keeping it simple is better. 
CON:The Chicago dog was too sweet, the all-beef weiner had a weird taste and the bread was soggy by the time I got it. And the cheese fries were ok: nice fries with grated yellow cheese melted on it
PRO: Place has a cool vibe, and people are laid back.This place is very friendly and the staff is very accommodating. They let us bring in outside food and the bartender offered me a refill on my soda pop (since I had ice cream left over). They have a bunch of flatscreens for big games and the ambiance is great. Gotta try the alligator dog!!Dat Dog Haikus part II 
Part I is here - http://www.yelp.com/biz/dat-dog-new-orleans-2?hrid=oNyuc1N5fSlGg49HMsyKuA
Oh, Hallelujah!
Praise God and all of the Saints!
They take credit cards.
This scenic vista
What an expansive courtyard
Fancy hotdog place
Beautiful hotdogs!
Shove them in my face quickly,
So I may drink beer
One: Eat a hot dog
Two: Get a tattoo next door
Three: Success at life
So many tube meats!
Wieners, hotdogs, sausage, franks
so much fun to say!This place is funky and fun with good prices and a bunch of toppings to choose from. I got the hot bratswurth, with onion, tomatoes, creole mustard, and sour cream. It was super yummy and juicy. It wasn't spicy however. I'm from New Orleans though, so unless I'm crying and my nose is running it's not hot enough, haha. But still very good. Excited to go back and try the rest!Best wiener in town!! Wish we have this in Cali!! So many options to choose from.  Place is well decorated. Cool staff!!Really love this place. I've had the polish sausage and the Slovenian both excellent.  The bun they use is very good which is key to me.  Ton of options for toppings, and if your indecisive they recommend some to you.  And there is a huge outdoor area with park benches.  I come here on Wednesdays for trivia and it's a ton of fun.Dat Dog is awesome. There are many dogs to choose from and no matter which you choose you can't go wrong! Expert dogologists will create a weekly masterpiece or order off the menu with the toppings you want. This location is in what was a uniform store next to New Orleans Music Exchange at Magazine & Louisiana. The staff is awesome!!!! One of my favorite places!!!!What a shame this place has gone downhill
We used to walk up here 2-3 times a week
Now, maybe once every several months
Today stopped by to grab a beer or 2 sat down out on patio & sat there for 10-15 minutes then left
Saw bartender waking back & forth chatting with a man asking what he does etc
She never knew I was there
So I left
Now down at bulldog have been waited on & asked if "I'm good"
ŸSaw this place on a Youtube food review show called Day of Gluttony. I've been to both the Magazine Street location and the Frenchmen Street location. The Magazine Street location is WAY nicer with more seating and a nice outdoor area with a bar. The service at both locations was top notch. 
I've had the crawfish fries, bacon werewolf sausage, and the Guinness sausage here.  Between the two sausages I preferred the bacon werewolf since the sausage itself tasted better on that one. The Guinness sausage tastes like a Jimmy Dean breakfast sausage and the Guinness flavor is not that good. These sausages were ok but really nothing groundbreaking to me. 
 The stand out dish in my opinion from here is the crawfish fries. The fries themselves taste like Checkers/Rallys fries and have the same crunchy consistency. That's already a win in my book. But then the fries are covered in a crawfish etouffee with diced tomatoes and sour cream. I recommend mixing this dressing up evenly over the fries. This was the first time I've ever had crawfish and initially I wasn't a fan of the fishy taste and oyster like chewiness when I ate the pieces individually with a fry. Mixing the dressing up evenly distributes the flavor of the crawfish (drowning out the fishy flavor) and adds a meaty element to the dish that I appreciated. The tomatoes and sour cream really works well with the etouffee, providing some contrasting flavors to the dish. I'm usually not that hype about chili fries and dishes like that but this particular dish really impressed me and I highly recommend it if you should ever decide to stop in. 
Check out my pictures of the dogs and fries.After exploring the Garden District for several hours we decided to look for a late afternoon nosh.  I had read about Dat Dog after researching New Orleans lunch spots on Yelp but was pleasantly surprised upon walking in to see that they also had a full bar!  Seeing as we were parched from walking and the humidity, it felt as though we were being rewarded by the universe for making such a good choice.   And good choice it was- we had some delicious sandwiches- honestly I cant remember which ones- but I imagine that they are all good.   I mean, how does one go wrong with grilled bread topped with any variety of sausages and toppings?  You don't.  The staff and atmosphere seem very laid back- perfect for an afternoon snack.The food is excellent and the staff are friendly. The only thing keeping them from getting five stars is that they are a cash only business - no cards accepted.
True to their name they have a wide variety of sausages and hot dogs ranging from kielbasas to Italian sausages, andouille, bratwurst and more. The restaurant is a monument to the sausage. They do have vegetarian sausages as well, and the occasional specials they offer locally made sausages. They are served on a wonderful Italian bread bun that is just about perfection in bread form. 
I suggest getting the chef dressed variant of whatever particular sausage you order, they have never done me wrong. During happy hour the drinks are two for one; however they give you a token for another drink that they will honor pretty much whenever. 
They are also a dog friendly establishment. It's a great place to take your puppy with you if you want to sit outside with them.The food was pretty good but I haven't had such unfriendly service anywhere else in New Orleans. The cashier was incredibly surly- no smiles, no nothing. I asked for a recommendation between two options and she shrugged and said nothing. I'd read online that they have shakes and homemade sodas, so when I asked about drink options, she basically just pointed me towards a row of fountain sodas, so I ended up ordering one of those before seeing that you could get better drinks at the actual bar. And then it took me almost half an hour to get my food. The clearly unenthusiastic service made the weird cheer they all do when they get a tip even weirder- like it all just felt terribly forced. If the stuff doesn't have energy for basic politeness, don't go through the motions of acting enthusiastic about your tips. Dat Dog is, to be honest- gussied up drunk food, and there are other places in the city where the service is substantially better and the food is just as good. I probably won't be back here.3 stars because the vegan hot dogs are just Field Roast sausages - nothing special or exciting about that. I could make it at home for the same price and get 6 dogs out of it! What saved this place was their good local beer selection and happy hour deal (which included a vegan dog!) Nice people, good music, funky decor, very enjoyable on a cool summer day.This place is truly a unique place to enjoy something other than the norm.  Seriously, where else can you get a Crawfish Etouffee sausage?  Of course they also had andouille sauce for the gator sausage, creole mustard, and a dozen other unique things.  It was a really fun experience, even if we probably annoyed the waitress by being indecisive for about 10 minutes.  I wish I could've tried more stuff!  The price is moderate for the portion of food you get, but it's worth it in my opinion.  The other guy that said "a hot dog is a hot dog" probably never drove in a Lexus, or drinks discount beverages from Dollar Tree.  These are not ordinary dogs.  I highly recommend it for an adventurous lunch with the family, or an interesting date option.I had a BLT on a hot dog. My man had the ranch bacon cheese fries. Calorific Glory! Lots of interesting add ons and sauces. Delicious!I've been to Dat Dog so many times. It's so simple, ask yourself, would you go to the grocery store and buy 20 toppings and top the dog yourself? Probably not, if you do you're borderline insane. Anyway, that's why we have Dat Dog. It's such a simple concept, I get annoyed that I go at times, then I remind myself I wouldn't top my hotdog like that at all. Anyways don't forget to get the white trashy fries, along with whatever dog you happen to choose. But seriously, just get the chefs special. They just have too many toppings to choose for yourself.I had been wanting to visit Dat Dog with my weenie dog for a while now (yes, I am that sort of person, taking pictures of my dog in front of signs). I can't say I am a big fan of hot dogs, but I do love a good Chicago dog from time to time.  My husband and I stopped in on our walk down Magazine St, and decided to finally give it a try. We shared the étouffée fries and a chipotle veggie dog. The fries were so delicious! I had a hard time deciding between these and the pomme frites but think I chose correctly. (I'll have the pomme frites next time!) I did think the veggie dog was a tad overly seasoned, but my husband loved it.  The ability to choose your own dog and toppings, while a seemingly great idea, is a little daunting for someone like me; when given too many options I can go a little overboard which usually results in bad combos. Mea culpa! Anyways, I was impressed with the different varieties of meat offered here - alligator? Now that is just awesome to a Southwestern girl like me. I will definitely keep it in mind on our next visit.
We sat outside, which was a great atmosphere! Big, yellow umbrellas kept us shaded, and a waitress brought over a water bowl for our dog. (thank you!) There are big screen TVA set up along the outside bar, which were perfect for watching a World Cup game. All in all, we had a good experience here and are looking forward to our next visit to try more menu items.Me and my dude just sampled the gator dog with andouille sauce, étouffée, creole mustard, onion, bacon, and tomatoes.  Weird combo... But oh soooo good.   The bun is perfectly steamed and a bit sweet. When you bite into the dog, the casing snaps a bit, which I like.  The dog itself is juicy and flavorful. Pretty addictive.Man does this place have great hot dogs. I got the Louisiana hot sausage (from Harahan) with tomatoes, white onions, and andoullie sauce, which is this delicious gravy like sauce with chunks of andoullie sausage in it. It all is packed into a freshly steamed sourdough bun that has a great little hint of sweetness to it. Order some cajun fries and a Barq's root beer and grab a seat outside for some fresh air while you eat.So it's a place that I've always wanted to try and I got a chance to try during for Mardi Gras. My stepdad I went he had the Guiness sausage hotdog and I had the crawfish étouffée hotdog and we both shared bacon and cheese fries. Oh my gosh the hotdogs were simply amazing I mean, hotdogs are already good, but for them to mix it up in so many different varieties was the icing on the cake. And we're not talking any regular degular hotdogs these are the best of the best meats honey. It's clearly coming to be a New Orleans staple!I LOVE Dogs and these are terrific, in all their permutations. I had a Dat Chick that was so tender and delicious. The sauce and coleslaw mad it extra yum. I asked for fried extra crispy and they accommodated with golden brown fries. My partner had the Sea Dog with all the trimmings except the mustard and onions. It got his thumbs up. 
Sorry we don't have more time in NOLA I'd be back for more.You want a Dog in NOLA.... Dat Dog is where you will find it.  Don't go in bad weather because there is limited seating inside.  Damn Good Hot Dog.I'm a sucker for a hot dog joint and this place did not disappoint.  We went the Saturday night before Halloween, so the place was packed.  My boyfriend led me upstairs, which with the crowd, I'd never have even known was there.  Upstairs has a great balcony that overlooks the street.  On this particular night, there was a street performance that was fantastic, so we hung out for a while.   
We ordered some dogs at the upstairs bar.  Given the crowd, the wait was reasonable and the dogs hit the spot. Will definitely return.It was the only place available to eat in New Orleans for a group of 6 during prime time on a Saturday night. I was kind of bummed but Dat Dog did a good job in trying to make up for my lack of foresight. It's a great location, placed right next to all these cool bars in the Frenchman Street area. They had a huge selection of different dogs and toppings. I was very satisfied with our meal in the end, and we went on our marry way. Bar hopping the night away.I got the Spicy Chipotle Veggie Dog, I asked the girl at the register what she thought about toppings and she said "I'd make it like a taco...jalapenos, guacamole, pico de gallo". She was right, it was friggin delicious! 
The second floor balcony seating is a great place to hear the music on the street below.I love hot dogs!  Just wish they had a Chicago style dog b/c that was what I was cravingBest hot dog ever!! I had the crawfish dog dressed with chipotle mayo, mustard, ketchup, and guacamole. So good! 
I also shared some bacon, cheddar, ranch fries. These were good too.
I liked dat dog so much that I wanted it to be my last meal in NOLA, but it was still closed when I got there at 11:08am :/Had the polish hot dog. Very tasty. The duck sausage was amazing. Great service. Try the crawfish étouffée fries. Pretty wonderful.Cheap food in one of the most emblematic street in New Orleans (while mostly jazz clubs are) of course their specialty are hot dogs.
If you don't decide which one you want to fix it, just tale one of the recommendations (specials). 
They have alligator and duck meats.Came to this place due to rave reviews. The table was filthy and full of sticky dirt. The waitress wiped it with a dry napkin. The food was ice cold. The manager came and apologized and took care of HALF of the bill. He promised us hot food. I would have preferred to leave this dump. No water nor soda refills. I got up to get our water several times. The waiters have no training in customer service and they too were angry. They were short staffed and running around trying to do what they could. 
Sadly if you have no staff close a section down and offer the same service you feel is right. They will never see me again. What a waste of time and money.  One star is too many.  Sorry to say.Loved our experience here at Dat Dog. It has a very casual, college feel with reasonable prices on most items. Even better, the food is excellent, and there's a great bar for beer and liquor. When we went, there was an excellent gin limeade on special for $5; could not recommend strongly enough.
Enjoyed my hot sausage and fries.
ALSO, this place is truly dog friendly with multiple water bowls and leash teathers outside on their porch. Had a great experience with our dog Daisy.Zach was such an awesome bartender! He def made sure we had a great time--it was my friend's birthday and he was super cool. Great vibes and great food!Inside and outside seating, but really the large front door is always open so the inside is warm and has as many flies as the outside.
Having said that, the atmosphere is friendly, cozy and fits perfectly in the area of Freret Street that is experiencing a renaissance. The menu is extensive for hotdogs (of course) but not overly impressive as far as condiments go and they don't serve anything else other than a couple of sides (fries - or cheese fries, or chili cheese fries or ettouffe fries).
What really makes the dogs special (IMHO) is the buns, which are fresh, squishy sourdough. The bar has a decent selection of local beers and a small assortment of hard alcohol. The staff is very friendly and very efficient. 
The main drawbacks are: hot throughout the summer; a lot of flies; cash only.
The pros: awesome buns; good dogs, good service, atmosphere.We came by on recommendation from friends who recently visited. The hot dogs weren't bad, but nothing spectacular either. We had the Chicago dog, and a regular dog with chili. We had a few beers as well while siting at the bar. Being in the service industry as a bartender myself, I was pretty disappointed with the bar staff that day. Not the most friendly, nor said much to us, and upon leaving no comment on the way out, which threw me off since we heard her say goodbye to plenty of patrons prior to us leaving.  A bit off-putting.  The man in the hot dog suit behind bar was super friendly however.I enjoyed the service and food here. While we were waiting for the jazz band to play at the Spotted Cat, we decided to refuel with some hot dogs. I asked the bartender what was the most famous item and he recommended the crawfish hot dog. I ordered it and it was AMAZING! That was my first time eating crawfish too so it was a great first experience. And it wasn't too packed so it was perfectTried out Dat Dog this afternoon. 
Things I liked:
The buns. Big sourdough bun, lightly toasted. Holds the dog well. 
The fries. Served fresh and hot. "Rally"(like the fast food joint) style Cajun fries. Very good. 
The condiments. Nice option of about 8-10 condiments for the dog. All free. I had mustard, relish and onions on my smoked sausage. Other options included tomatoes, guac, chipolte sauce, etc.
Service was very friendly.
Things I dealt with: 
The sausage and the price. The free condiments I guess can offset the $6 price of the sausage. Add $3 fries and drink and you are looking at $12 meal. Ample food, so not a huge complaint. 
The sausage itself was only average. I had the smoked sausage. I like my sausage cooked a little more, with a little more crunch on outside than how they serve. Was slightly chewy on outside and found myself laboring to pull it apart with my teeth. It still tasted good, but I prefer crunchy outside, soft inside. Just easier to bite into if cooked a little more in my unexpert (is that a word?) opinion.
Dislikes: 
Their space is very small. Not only the place itself, but the tables. It was hard to even fit all our food on the table. Seating is extremely limited to maybe 15 people, inside and outside.
There is no AC. Today it was 92 degrees and it was cooler outside than inside. Though there are umbrellas outside for shade, I can't see myself eating there during the summer. Gonna be miserable. Take it to-go.
Finally our canned drinks were luke warm. They were in a cooler, so Im not sure what the deal was. Didn't mesh well on this hot day.
All in all was a decent meal. Employees very friendly. There were 3 of us, and we all came away with similar sentiments. Food is OK but not good enough for what is supposedly to be a specialty place to sit there and sweat and eat during a New Orleans summer.Excellent chili cheese fries (although I wish the cheese was melted!).  I had the bratwurst, which was fantastic, as was the bun.  At first I thought it was too much bread but the lightly toasted, slightly sweet bread won me over.  I got a little carried away with toppings though and I think the guacamole was a)overkill and b)not really a great iteration of guacamole anyway.  Next time I will practice some restraint.Before I moved back to NOLA, I was a 90% vegetarian. Now I'm a 50% vegetarian, so I have plenty of time to eat hot dogs. And this was worth it! I got a standard hot dog with chili and onions and a side of cheese fries. Both were delicious and definitely too much for one person (3 of us couldn't make it through all those fries).
The atmosphere at dinner was perfect - super relaxed and even cool enough to enjoy sitting outside on their patio. Everyone seemed to be enjoying the great happy hour specials too.
BUT I've withheld a star for one reason only: so many fancy toppings but I don't know what to do with them, because I'm not a chef. It would be amazing if they recommended certain combos and created a few themed dogs beyond just the 1-2 specials of the day. We definitely weren't the only ones staring blank-faced at the menu, only to worry that we hadn't been adventurous enough...There are three locations for Dat Dog and this was my first visit to the Frenchman street location. First off, its not just a weenie place, there are every imaginable variation to the tube meat product, from the traditional pork or beef to the crawfish to the "Sea Dog" (fish) to the more exotic alligator and variation to the polish. You have a range of toppings and if your brave enough, you can just trust to the chiefs judgement. At the this location there is also an upstairs dinning hall with a really great balcony that has a view worth the visit. I came here with a large group of very skeptical eaters and everyone left happy and full. They also make a terrific Margarita here and sell beer by the pitcher.Excellent atmosphere for a get together with an old college buddy. Perfect food & ambiance if you're in the mood to just enjoy your time with someone you enjoy being with. 
THE DOGS are awesome too. You can't really go wrong with any of the choices.I've been to one on Feret and the hot dog was huge. I was disappointed when I opened my container to find such a small hot dog for 8.00.I don't even know where to begin with this place. I've been going to Dat Dog since it was just a little shack on Freret street (before it was franchised and when the original owner was still there). I bought it was really cool, new and a great creative spend on hotdogs. But since expanding the new locations like the frenchmen one turned me off completely to eating at any other dat dog! Eating in there was very unpleasant they have a gnat problem and the staff is just everywhere. There's drunk bartenders, rude employees and just seems way too unorganized. I don't know what management  this place is under but they clearly lack any background on business management knowledge. In the past, I was served quality food at other Dat Dog locations but this one was ridiculous. The HUGE problem I had with this place was it appears they had a pipe problem occurring where the bathroom pipes leaked to the kitchen area around the food! I was disgusted out and immediately got out of there! I understand that things like that can possibly happen but they remained opened and remain serving food while the kitchen is under that condition! You couldn't pay me to step foot in any of the dat dogs now that was totally unhygienic! How are the even passing health inspections. This place is a disaster and I fault management!We went here three times during our visit Wednesday-Sunday. 
Our first visit gets a five star review for Hans--overwhelmed by the menu, we let him order for us. We got two amazing dogs (one a duck dog with bacon and a ton of toppings, one a spicy dog with sriracha mayo, pico, sour cream, creole mustard, and relish (amazeballs), plus fries. Hans wins everything ever.
Our second trip, we showed up around midnight on Thursday for a to-go order, asking for the bacon werewolf, fries, and my spicy dog from above--they missed a few toppings.
Tonight, (saturday, ok) we ordered one Guinness special dog and an order of fries with extra ketchup. It took over forty minutes. We had already tipped over twenty percent and waited longer for our food than anyone behind us. The staff were nice and apologetic, but it tookthat long, and asking where our food was, before they told us "someone stole [our] order after they called it once" (which they didn't, we were standing right by the counter) before they resent the order. When we finally got it and checked, we had to ask for ANY ketchup, much less extra. So that was a bummer. But those fries though. Yummmm.
It's great food, but seems like service might suffer a bit during busy late night rushes. If you go for lunch Tuesday-Sunday, order from Hans, and it'll be amazing.The best fries I've EVER had! I got the seasoned fries and drizzled the with ketchup and Louisiana hot sauce....best thing ever! The environment was cool, a little hectic but we went on a Friday night. If you go definitely try the seasoned friesI've been looking for a place to satisfy my hot dog cravings as I miss Chicago dogs dearly! 
I've had many a disappointing dog in NOLA, and was expecting the worst. To my extreme delight, my meal was downright delicious! Cannot recommend this place enough!
Upon a friend's suggestion I got the kielbasa dog as well as the Guinness and German Beef. SWEET BABY JESUS ON A BUN THE KIELBASA IS TO DIE FOR!! The standard German beef was fantastic, the Guinness....eh..it was good, but not great. Fries are pretty good, albeit a bit on the soft side and I suggest holding off on the chili for any item as it is bland and detracts from the flavor of your meal.OOOOMYYYY, what amazing hot dogs
I didnt care to get one (only bc on vaca) bc im a New Yorker and the best and only hot dogs i eat are NYC hotdogs on the corner lmao.
Well let me say i was BLOWN AWAY!
Got the duck dog special with bbq, mustard, bacon, jalapenos. Like sooo good, the bread, the dog. The sauces huba huba
Def recommend!Duck dog is awsome... our bartender hans was even better great recommendations and quite handsome for being slightly balding... great Hawaiian  shirt tooSeriously delicious weiners.... Dat Dog is a lovely new addition to Freret Street and a welcomed one at that. Ever since the secret got out about Dat Dog, I had to check out the place for myself. It's a cute little place with New Orleans charm. I love the selection of international sausages that they feature! My favorite sausages are the German Bratwurst and the Polish Kielbasa. The free toppings are bonus too ranging from non traditional choices like the guacamole to andouille sauce to the traditional ones of onions and sauerkraut! Not only do they grill the dogs, but they grill the buns as well...yum... I have yet to try their fries but they always look delicious! Having met one of the co-owners, Constantine, I know that they are committed to making a good dog. Dat Dog is the perfect treat on a sunny afternoon! You gotta go check it out!(To the tune of "Poison" by Bell Biv Devoe)
Y'all, I must 
(warrnnnnnn youuuuuu)
I'm feeling hunger pangs in my tum
(Situation is serioouuuuuusssss)
Few too many tipples of that rumm......
I'm oh-so-RAVENOUUUUUSSSS
But headed over to Rue Freret
Need something deliciouuuuuussssss
May I suggest hot dogs? (yes, you may!)
It's driving me outta my mind
Great menu, and it's so hard to find
Can't figure out which I will eat
sausage, gator, bratwurst
Dat Dog's addictiiiiiiveeeeeee
Never wanna leave this place......
Dat Dog's addictiiiiiiveeeeeee
And now, I'm gonna stuff my face.....
Ok, I can only do Biv so much justice, but figured I'd bring some flavor to a review for a spot that delivers so much of their own! I nabbed an alligator sausage because "when in Rome" and had them go for the Chef's Choice because who knows better how to top this meaty mass?
The result was a terribly sloppy dining experience complete with no less than ten napkins, oodles of satisfied "mmmm"s from my dining partners and I, and a belly that was full for the next 8 hours. My buddies and I split the bacon cheddar ranch fries (divine, nice even toppings) and I honestly couldn't fit another bite of real food in my belly until a late dinner (this was an early lunch). 
PERFECT hangover food, great with a beer or wacky cocktail of the day (I personally recommend beer, there's too many flavors to add much else!) The price is right for the amount of food you get, and the vibe is fun. Bring a jacket in the colder months, there's no heating and the doors stay open!Ask for Hans, he makes the experience! Get the DUCK dog!!! Absolutely to die for! The crawfish etoufee fries are amazing!Hands Down, if you haven't tried a Dog from here u need to get their ASAP.  The guys and gals that work there know me when I walk in.  
I had a conversation with a few of the employees and they witnessed people actually going through their trash to figure out where they were getting their Dogs and Buns from.  I even tried to sneak the question of who was their supplier and I was met with a blank stare and a change of conversation...lmao.
No body ain't gonna beat DAT DOG.This place was a dump. Basically a bar that serves hot dogs. Music was blaring and the place was crowded, so we went to their upstairs seating area and sat in a booth. I ordered the alligator dog and my companion ordered a basic German style hot dog. I am guessing that alligator is an acquired taste because I didn't like it at all. It was very gamy tasting. Even if I would have liked what I ordered, the rolls they serve their dogs on are way too big and doughy. The bathrooms were also filthy and filled with graffiti.You got to build your own Hotdog!! The selection for toppings were vast and their "off the menu" items were delicious. Their best off the menu item had duck sauce, raspberry paste, bacon and more !!! My only compliant is with the staff. They weren't that friendly, however their flavorful dogs makes it a place to gothis place has an awesome variety of local and international dogs, sausages, brats, kielbasas. etc. these grilled dogs come on an awesome sourdough bun, which is a perfect finsihing touch. however, my favorite aspect of Dat Dog is that you can get pretty much any topping you can dream of- for free :) their hand-cut fries are essential to try as well. you've gotta try this place.If you want to get your DOG on this is the place. The fries are delish too. My NOLA replacement for Viscous dog in NOHO.Great location on Frenchmen street. There were for of us we ordered three duck special, gator special, son of saint and a build your own. Along with cheese and chili cheese fries. Being a condiment hound at heart, I love this place! The buns are tasty, condiments generous, and grab a couple drinks at the upstairs bar. Get a spot upstairs on the balcony you might get lucky enough to see the Frenchmen play some awesome tunes! A do again for me.. You can't beat the vibe and the grub.Loved the outdoor seating. Good happy hour, 2 for 1 draft beers.Nothing special - for the price, I would expect a hot dog that was Costco or Sam's Club size.  What was definitely yummy was the White Trash Fries!!  Yummy!  Other than that, they are hot dogs that you need to eat with a fork and knife - with all the toppings available, the flavors just melt together and nothing really unique.  I wouldn't mind eating here again, but I'm not in a hurry, well, except maybe for the fries!I LOVE this place! I'm so glad they expanded their space to across the street in the old Gas Station.
The Feret area has really blossomed and I'd say that this student-friendly and creative eatery is the perfect centerpiece for how the street has found it's Niche.
The Chef's Special is a risk everyone should be willing to take! Whoever's cooking that day makes your Dog unique - make sure you mean it when you tell them "Surprise me" because they will!
Bottled Barq's and Mexican Cokes or your choice from the bar and Soda Fountain give this place a little something extra - along with the wooden benches and big open courtyard it's just a great place to gorge yourself while hanging with friends.
I'm Hungry just writing about it right now.
Be warned though - I had to unbutton my pants and pop a few Antacids after my last trip there and I don't think most vegans could find options on the menu,
but for this self-professed carnivore, I couldn't have been happier.Best hotdogs in NOLA, if not in the world!!!  Everyone knows that Dat Dog is known for their unique and outstanding sausages.  They offer alligator sausage, crawfish sausage, hot sausage, and many different foreign sausages.  The fries and chili cheese fries are seriously addicting!  Are they putting some special substance in their food???  JK!  But anyways, my boyfriend and I shared the alligator sausage hot dog and a plate of fries the other night, and they were amazing!  I've also had the hot sausage and crawfish sausage; both are to-die-for!  You're allowed to have as many toppings as you want with no extra charge.  (The hot dogs are $6).  We topped our dog with onions, jalapenos, andouille sauce, relish, and ketchup.  So delish!  And the fries....OMG I could not stop eating those fries!  They were sooooo goood!  And I don't know why!
Dat Dog is located literally two minutes from my school, so I fortunately am lucky enough to have it whenever I want, although, too much will mean extra lbs!Had the chef's special Alligator dog and regular fries...AMAZING! Everything was fresh, the drinks were great. Dat Dog is definitely a must when coming to NOLA. The view was also amazing from the upper level deck.Came here with J and K before heading out to 3090 to watch some bands and Blue Nile to see my first brass band. Walked in, sat at the bar. Ordered some drinks while glancing over the menu.  Ordered an old fashioned...and I will say, I have found only one place that makes a decent old fashioned in this towb. This was not the place. 
HOWEVER, the dogs were amazing. They had 10-12 different ones to choose from. And being from Seattle, I love what we call a Seattle dog (which basically means it comes with cream cheese- understandable that it's not for everyone).  But, I went with their fried chicken dog and it was the best choice. Perfectly cooked chicken, crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside. Came topped with slaw, "chick" sauce, and pickled jalapeños. All on a brioche type bun, buttery and toasted. We also got the cheese fries- which I recommend. And K got the sea dog. A giant piece of fried cod with tartar and mustard and he liked it a lot. The fish was battered and fried perfectly. Will definitely come back here the next time I'm in town.My girlfriend and I both ordered veggie dogs, and we both got sick immediately afterwards. Clearly there is a food-handling issue, or maybe someone back there wasn't trained in proper hand-washing protocol. I've never heard of anyone getting sick from eating something that contained no meat or seafood. We used to like the food here, but it's not worth risking getting sick for.
Also, cash-only is a major joke in 2013. This place was already robbed once because they happily advertise this policy. Get with the times and take credit cards.Super disappointed in this place. Easily the worst $60 dinner for my family I've spent in a very long time. For starters, while the waitress got our drink orders quickly, it took quite a while for her to get back to take our food order, and we were the only table upstairs at the time. We felt she was more interested in watching the movie on the tv than getting to us. Next, I was amazed at the amount of time it took for us to get our food. Then we we did get it, out of 6 items ordered, only 2 were correct. Add to that, when it was brought back out, they still got our fries wrong. (No tomatoes, no onions... Not that hard.) The food was warm, definitely not hot. And the amount of creole mustard on both mine and my son's dogs was way overkill. I'm pretty certain the chili was basic canned chili. Not impressed. I would think a good dog place would have something home made rather than something that tastes like you got it at the ball park. The sausages were good and I do like the bread. Oh and if you're going to charge $2.75 for a fountain drink, serve it in a cup with some size to it. Not sure if the other locations are better, but regardless, I cannot see us returning.Delicious! This place is one of a kind. When you're tired of eating the same old thing, head out to Dat Dog. Delicious burgers!They stole Rally's french fries and put Poppy Tookers name on it. 
I love Poppy Tooker, but she has to be just as disappointed as I am with the frozen, pre-seasoned fries at Dat Dog. To add insult to injury, these are the exact french fries that they serve at Rally's... the most dispicable fast food restaurant ever. 
Making homemade french fries is easy and potatoes are cheap! I wish Dat Dog had better french fries... we would eat there more often!
Good Hot Dogs. btw.Absolutely incredible! After living in Chicago for a number of years, I'm slightly biased towards places like Hot Doug's (RIP) and Franks-n-Dawgs...but Dat Dog came highly recommended and boy did it deliver!! AMAZING crawfish and alligator sausages!! Next time I'm in NOLA, I will definitely try the fries! Also, be adventurous a get your dog "chefs choice"....I did and yummmmThe BEST sausage dog I've ever had, crawfish sausage up top and alligator sausage pictures below. The alligator has sour kraut, bacon& mustard. A must stop while listening to live music on Frenchmen St. 
The drinks are better priced and have more alcohol that drinks on Bourbon.Well I have been to Dat Dog on magazine multiple times and have loved it. Dat dog also has two other locations and highly recommend going there for some of the best hotdogs around.yummy! I actually haven't eaten enough here, but everything I get is delicious. I wish they would go a little heavier on the toppings, though!This is truly an amazing place.  Food was good, drinks were good but above it all, my group and I had so much fun here!  Shout out to Colin who is awesome and showed us a good time!  LACTAID BOYZThis original location is cash only, so remember that. Freret street offers the best carnival type foods! Pizza, burgers, etc. Dat Dog has the best fresh hot dogs with unlimited toppings to satisfy everybody's own special palate. Any of the loaded fries are tasty, étouffée fries, white trash fries, but honestly with a topped hot dog I prefer the plain fries. Great flavor. Everything here is flavorful and the buns for the hot dogs are sweet and delicious as well.I'm not a big fan of hot dogs but I like this place because it's unique, local, artsy and has good quality food. If you like sea food and want to try something different instead of just crawfish or catfish then get a hot dog made of it! Another huge plus is its location. This is a bar/club area and it's perfect to eat well before drinking and dancing. Literally 2 mins from the best places in the city.Colin's milkshakes bring all the customers to the yard...
Seriously though, Dat Dog makes great milkshakes.Lunch here was ok as we got the crawfish etouffee dogs. They were pretty good and surely recommend. The fried were hot as we got the chili cheese ones. It was just the tables were not as cleaned off as shouldve been. And not busy at time the staff needed be cleaning not chilling.
Beers were lil pricey and in can(mich ultra).Got the étouffée dog. There wasn't very much étouffée and the crawfish dog was a bit dry. However, the flavors were great. I'm thinking the aforementioned issues were a fluke. I'd definitely try the place again.I had the german weiner dog regular size and i was very happy with it, the buns are just exelents and the weiner is even better. Me and my friend shared some cheese fries and we were kinda bummed that the chese wasnt melted... and kind of annoying since we couldnt eat any of the cheese on the fried... it would fall off. so thats why I wont give it 5 stars. My boyfriend got a hot luisiana dog and it was very delisious even tho he had it plain with nothing on it. Very very good hot dogs would think twice about getting those cheese fries...Great spot for a good meal and cold beer. Lots of choices and variety on the dogs and the beers. Chicago dog was disappointing as they don't use authentic ingredients, but that won't scare me away. I'll definitely be back.Great location and pretty good food after a night on Frenchmen Street.  They have some very creative hot dog recipes.  The only reason that I'm giving it a 3 instead of 4 is due to their prices.  I felt that they were a little high for a hot dog, although the hot dog was very good!Don't take Dat Dog for granted.
Great original sausages.
Warm, fresh bun.
All of the toppings you could ever want.
The only downside is all the Tulane kids using their parents' credit cards to sometimes ruin the vibe.
I think they could step up their french fry game, adding some custom aiolis, but maybe I'm just an aioli guy.Yum, hot dogs. It's divey and it's hippy and it's full of delicious gourmet hot dogs. I had a german smoked bratwurst with onions and cheese (there's a variety of toppings you can choose from). I generally don't like to put anything on my hot dogs just because I want to have the opportunity to taste the dog itself. This hot dog was awesome, and the buns that they use (steamed and toasted sourdough) made it so much better.  I was also in for a nice surprise with the golden browned fries, next time maybe I'll attempt to get the cheese fries.
This will definitely be my go to place for hot dogs when I have a craving and I'm going to make it a point to try every type of hot dog they have, possibly the crawfish and the slovenia dog.  They do have more traditional choices, such as a regular german beef or pork weiner for those non adventurous types.This is the best place I ever been to that served hot dogs on a bun!  They have such a variety, that the possible combinations of what you can eat here has to be in the tens of thousands!I can't believe we ate a hotdog on vacation, but we were starving and needing food. We got keilbasa with chipoltle mayo and grilled onions and the bacon cheddar ranch fries.  Not a crumb left!  The only downside is that it's so crowded and you have to get inbetween people and yell your order to the bartender.  The people at the bar seemed annoyed by this and I would be too.Love love love Dat Dog. I love trying new dogs and always get it topped with chef's choice because they know exactly what should be the best with each of their dogs! And the hot dog bun is to die for. Never disappointed with my food.Cold food, rude bartender, customers shooting drugs right outside the Window  on the street.  Thats what you get when you go to this place.  Avoid this place at all costs.  Oh btw I forgot the  flys everywhere inside are so bad you can't even eat your food.   
I never leave reviews but this place is so bad I had to share.HOLY SHIT.  Just go.  Stop reading this right meow, get here and stuff your face.
Built my own, Kielbasa and a couple of sauces, toasted bun.  Chili cheese fries.  I don't smoke, but needed one after this.  Great vibe, too.  Now put down the phone and go eat.Delicious! I love their pork dog with caramelized onions, bacon, and ketchup. Yummm... I would give it 5 stars, but I tried their bacon cheddar ranch frieds (sounded amazing), but they were super over-salted I could barely get through the first few fries. =\Super cool little place in the back cuts of the French quarter. Easy to walk to. Service was ok not to friendly. 
Paid $8 for a hotdog. But that's the way they are in the French quarter everything is over priced. 
The hotdogs had a few choices you could pick from 
Beef, pork, alligator.  You can pick for over 10 toppings. 
I would go back. It was good for kids also.This meal was a blurry one, as it was pretty late into the festivities, but it says  a lot of a place to leave a positive impression through all that fog of drinks. 
I had the duck sausage hot dog and absolutely loved it. They're heavy on sauces and toppings so be prepared for a potentially messy meal. Receipt I found in my pocket said I paid about $18 for my wife and I's hot dogs, which sounds about right for their size and quality. 
Looking forward to returning for round two in a week or so and will probably grab another bite if we're down on Frenchman and looking for some great late night food.I'm from out of town and this place was great. Our order was messed up and it never got started so after about twenty minutes of waiting after we ordered a worker came up and asked how everything was. I believe his name was Chris but I can't remember, anyway he asked how everything was and when we told him we were still waiting he went and personally checked on our order, after informing us that a mistake was made he put a rush on it and had it out to us in five minutes. He even comped us an order of loaded fries! Great food, even better service, will definitely be back next time I'm in town.If you like hot dogs, this is hot dog heaven! Every kind of sausage you can imagine (and even some you might not have) is available here. My spouse and I shared the duck sausage with cheese, creole mustard and blackberry sauce. This concoction was delicious! The duck sausage had a stronger and more distinct (but not overpowering) flavor than a typical hot dog. The mustard had a strong (but again, not overpowering) note of Dijon, and the kicker was most definitely the blackberry sauce. Blackberry sauce, you say? That's what I said, too, but it has just the right amount of sweetness to balance the savoriness and salt of the duck sausage and the creole mustard. I highly recommend that whatever sausage and other ingredients you get, that you top it off with blackberry sauce. I promise, you won't regret it!
We also got the cheese, bacon and ranch fries. The fries were well cooked. I love bacon, but my spouse and I agreed that this bacon was a little bit overpowering, heavily salty. 
As for other sausages you can get: alligator, kielbasa, brat, Slovenian, crawfish, Vaucresson hot (creole seasoned).
You should know that this place is very popular. You will stand in line and you will be intimately close with some new friends who are also hot dog lovers. But the wait and the crowd are completely worth it.Great location, balcony was a perfect view. The food was kind of bleh. Waitress was sweet though. Maybe just get a drink and enjoy the location here.Sorry.  This place just didn't work for me.  Small and uncomfortably hot is okay if the food is outstanding but these dogs were not.  Period.  Long wait for a run-of-the-mill hotdog.  And the 'veggie dog" was actually a veggie burger folded in two and squished into a hotdog bun. Ridiculous.  I've had better from a cart in front of Loew's Hardware.  Lotsa hype for a disappointing experience.Full disclosure: I am a hot dog fan.  I prefer hot dogs to hamburgers at cook outs.  I like all kinds of hot dogs, from hand-made all beef dogs at the butcher counter at Whole Foods to those red wieners filled with who-knows-what and lots of nitrates.  I watch the Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest every Fourth of July.  I keep a pack of Hebrew Nationals in the fridge at all times.  You may not like hot dogs as much as I do, so keep that in mind.  I also feel similarly passionate about sausages.  That said, I think Dat Dog serves up an abundance of tubular meat that are well worth a visit.  
Dat Dog offers two German hot dogs - traditional and all beef - and a variety of sausages from around the globe, including more regional Louisiana sausages.  I sampled two dogs - the traditional German beef frank and the hot brat from Germany (I like German sausage).  Dat dog offers a variety of toppings and all the stalwart dog fixin's are there, and some that are not so standard (wasabi, for example).  All are served on sourdough buns either toasted or steamed, and I prefer steamed for hot dogs.  I topped my hot brat with mustard and sauerkraut, and it was definitely one of the better bratwursts I've had in my time, and that includes a trip to Germany.  The hot dog was spot-on as well.  
For sides, they offer fries.  And I think that's it.  You can top your fries with cheese or chili and cheese or their bacon-ranch-cheese combo.  My only caveat about this is that the cheese is sprinkled on the fries and is not melted.  This is not a problem for me, because I got chili on my cheese fries, which melted the cheese, but my wife doesn't like chili so the lack of melted cheese bothered her although she agreed that the fries were very good.  Maybe Dat Dog II under construction across the street will have a broiler.  The beverage selection is nice with soft drinks, beer, and Mexican Coca-Cola, which for those who do not know, comes in glass bottles and is made the way Coke used to be made - with cane sugar, not high fructose corn syrup.
[NOTE:  Since I wrote this, Dat Dog II has opened across the street, and the cheese on the fries is now melted.  Good stuff.]
Really the only thing that missing from Dat Dog (other than melted cheese) is a baseball game to watch while eating it.Random walk in here for us but surprisingly this place had some of the most amazing hot dog sausages I have ever had! The one off duck sausage and complimentary sauce was outstanding and the Slovenian hot dog was spectacular! This is one my favorite hot dog joints in the US!I was surprised I would like a hot dog restaurant so much! I got the duck hot dog. Check out this video to see for yourself my experience: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHHYliWVGyU&list=UUXZoB1vUasYqR7GczFp_zeAI have been to dat dog many times, but i had a horrible experience this time. 
I will be going to other hotdog restaurants from now on. I understand it takes a lot time to order, this process needs to be changed. GET INTO THE 21st century. 
so, 40 minutes later we order. Then we sit down and people keep ordering and ordering. My brother who ordered 5 people after me got his order, then we wait, wait, wait wait wait wait and wait. Finally, we go and ask about our order. They go and look, but tell us nothing. 
Then 20 minutes later we go and ask what the problem is? The say they are working on it now. 
They had lost the ticket and didn't tell us tried to make it better. WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE.
once the food comes out its good and different, but admit to your mistakes and their wouldn't have been a problem in the first place.White Trash fries are everything one could want either before, mid way through, or after an evening of drinking.  Guacamole, sour cream, chili, cheese, jalapenos, onions, tomatoes, and more....they were a perfect appetizer and easily shared among three people.  I had the Werewolf Bacon dog on a Slovenian sausage.  The sausage was similar to a Kielbasa and quite flavorful.  The Creole mustard, herbs, and  bacon toppings were great, and toasted bun (similar to a lobster roll) kept all the toppings on the sausage.  I think it fits what Frenchmen has become--tourist haven.  Look for a burrito shack next.  Not that it's bad necessarily, but it is not the Frenchmen of even 4 or 5 years ago. 
$8 bucks for a dog is a bit much, and the small cocktails are on the pricey side too.  But, flavors are good, the toppings are plentiful, and you can choose as many as you want.  As a Chicagoan, it's not Hot Doug's.....but a decent sausage and quick food so you can get back into a club or plop yourself down on a curb and enjoy some of that live local music you come to Frenchmen to hear.  Big Ass beers for $5.00 on Frenchmen may be the way of the future for those longing for cheaper drinks.Nom nom nom nom nom.
This place is just freaking good.  Smoked sausage (go Harahan!) with guacamole, yellow mustard, ketchup, onions, tomatoes, various other toppings depending on my mood--oh how I love you.
The buns are good, the dogs are good, the toppings are good.  The new location is HUGE (at least compared to the old one that was basically in a closet) and will probably be amazing outdoor eating during the Fall/Spring (wait...we have a Fall or Spring in New Orleans?!).  It's still cash only (boo, I'm too lazy for cash).  The fries are so freaking good, I haven't even gotten around to ordering them with toppings--the plain ones are still rocking my world.  And one order of fries is enough to split between 2 or 3...perfect!
I took my brother here for his first meal when he came to visit this month and he looooved it. You just need to eat here, ok? Ok.I really enjoyed my first meal in New Orleans here at Dat Dog! The space was lively and full of energy at lunchtime on a Sunday, and I enjoyed sitting on the balcony. I ordered the duck special, a duck hot dog with bacon, blackberry sauce and barbecue sauce and was surprised by how blown of the the water I was. The hot dog was so delicious, the bun was fresh and crispy, and the flavors all paired really well. With other hot dog choices like alligator and crawfish, and an abundance of topping options, this is definitely the place to get a little creative with your hot dog. You won't be let down!Our airbnb host recommended this place to us, and we finally made our way here!  The restaurant itself is super cool.  They had a ton of outdoor seating as well as a very open inside area as well.  It is shaded, which was nice because it was quite warm outside still.  The menu is a bit overwhelming for someone who has a hard time making decisions, lol!  I ordered the Guinness brat with onions and mustard.  My husband ordered the all saints dog with chick sauce.  We ordered a side of fries too, which in my opinion were very heavily salted.  It was a cool experience and would probably go again!Fun place for lunch!  My son had the alligator dog; I had the special - Werewolf dog.  Both were great.  We also had the cheese fries and the white trash fries.  Can't really recommend the white trash fries.  They were completely as advertised - covered with EVERYTHING from chili to guacamole to slaw to cheese.  It was a bit too much.  
One thing to keep in mind - they only take cash, but they do have an ATM machine :)This place was pretty good. I had the spicy chipotle veggie dog with cheddar cheese and sauerkraut. Really good. The drinks were small and pricey, which was a bummer on an otherwise good dining experience. I'd go back for the food, not the drinks.Great place for a late night meal with friends. it was a little weird that I had to place my order upstairs and then pick it up back downstairs.I was overcharged 83$ on my credit card for 1 hot dog & 2 drinks.  Upon returning home from vacation and seeing this on my bank records, I immediatlely contacted the mgr (Joni) and she agreed to refund the overcharge.  Apparantly, she is no longer there and the new mgmt. is refusing to work with my bank.  If you go, PAY CASH or you too could be a victim of CC fraud.  DAT DOG also would not provide a copy of the receipt to my bank.  We will never return and will find many other places to enjoy ourselves in NOLA.  Shame on you DAT DOG!Finally had a chance to try this place after being away from New Orleans for so long. Many times I've envied my friends' pictures of their dogs and always said to myself, "must try this place asap!" To be honest, I was pretty underwhelmed with the dogs. Whomp whomp.
Food: I had the duck sausage, my boyfriend had the alligator sausage, and we also threw in some cheddar cheese fries w/bacon & ranch. We thought that everything was just okay. Maybe we set too high of expectations? :(
Service: It's counter service here. Our cashier was friendly and was more than willing to give me recommendations on what toppings to add with my duck sausage. I really have nothing bad to say about their service. Good ole' southern hospitality.
Tip: this place is CASH ONLY. There's an ATM on-site though if you can't access cash beforehand.
Overall, while we didn't think that this place was bad, we're just not sure if we'd go out of our way while we're in New Orleans to eat here.Superb selection of hotdogs. Must try the Alligator hotdog, it was very soft. 
 We had the polish one and the alligator one and both were amazing.Honestly, the food is awesome. But I had the most fun with the bartenders, Alexander and Nathaniel. Find me in New York boys!When I want a good hot dog this is where I come.  The menu is simple, dogs and fries.  I often choose the classic beef German style.  The nice this is that the condiments don't cost extra, and the possibilities are endless. However, when I am feeling indecisive, I will go for whatever the special is.  For example, I got the bacon werewolf last week, a Slovenian sausage, grilled onion, tomatoes, mustard, and bacon.  It was so good!  I have tried almost all of the fries too, they do not disappoint either.Really good food!  Nothing super fancy but definitely hit the spot.  You choose your sausage and then from a list of various toppings.  I had the traditional pork with ketchup, mustard and a dill pickle.  My friend had the chipotle vegan dog (the vegetarian option was a huge plus) with cheddar cheese and she said it was also good.  There are a few choices on fries, cheese fries, etc too.  I would recommend this place.Fun hipster place on Frenchmen Street! We had nice local beers, local "Louisiana hot sausage," crazy WTF fries and cheese fries, all while sitting on balcony and enjoying live music from down the street. 
The only negative thing I'll say is I wish the server warned us about how big the fries portions are!! My boyfriend and I each ordered a side of fries and regretted it...way too much food! 
Nice low key option for lunch or dinner. Would recommend!the server's knowledge of what was actually in the sausage was really good. Be mindful that if you don't eat pork, it isn't mentioned unless it is a pork sausage, so ask.
Very understanding of dairy allergies and adjusted the sauces in my dog accordingly.
There are vegan type sausages, we didn't try any so can't tell you if they were worth it or not.
The sausages were really good, buns, well geez, what are you wanting, it is just there to hold the internals.
I thought the price was high for what you got but the prices are quite neutral across the range be it duck or alligator or cow so I suppose something has to give and I think they found a balance.Highly disappointed in this place and it's sad because I love the one on magazine st!
First things first they didn't have much selection at the bar and no ginger ale either. 
Secondly the bartender was rude to my friend when he asked if they could customize drinks, she said "well we are a bar" with a sarcastic tone and I interrupted her saying some places don't customize drinks depending on what they want in the mix.
Thirdly, I was the first to order my Hot dog, we waited for almost ten minutes for them to tell my friend they could make what he was asking for and apparently the bartender didn't put my order in until they got my friends drink order. Mind you I'm the only one getting food my husband and friend were only getting drinks. We waited 10 minutes for my hot dog that hadn't even been put in yet! Needless to say I canceled my order. 
Last but not least, my husbands drink had cigarette ashes in it! When my husband said something The bartender looked at it and just made him a new one. The bartender looked into the red bull he used and seen there  were ashes on the can just to confirm it. And no we didn't get the replacement drink for free, yeah like if you get a hair in your food or a nail or whatever they replace it and comp you? Yeah didn't happen here my husband left with ash taste in his mouth.
I spoke to the manager who was nice but not sure she really understood what I was saying. 
Won't be returning.
Forgot to add, I seen the bartender pour both drinks... it was nothing near a shot in either of their cups.Frenchmen street - Amazing live music and Dat Dog will now go together hand in hand for me. 
Order the duck special (with blackberry sauce). Truly one of the best hot dogs I've had anywhere in the world. Thank you mr. bartender for the suggestion. My stomach thanks you.Delicious food, absolutely delicious!! Get the duck special and the loaded fries. Friendly and happy staff. Pretty good bar, too. We went every day of our trip, and everything we tried was creative and delicious xDI found it to be horrible.  The bun was double size of the dog.  Just didn't care for the food and service.  Will never go back .Love Dat Dog! I live down the street and frequent Dat Dog maybe once a week, whether that is for a beer, loaded fries, or the alligator dog. 2 for 1 special for Happy Hour. Dogs are welcome as well. The owner WILL spoil your dog with treats though. That is for sure.Just ok. Nothing to rave about. Staff was very nice. Table was sticky and it too too long to get our food.I have been to other locations of Dat Dog and was happy to find one on Frenchman.  Loved the balcony and that the waiter comes to take your order.  I am use to prices of their dogs but $9.50 for a bloody mary was a bit much.  Maybe they are expecting tourist to pay that much for cute drinks.  Next time will go else where for a cocktail but will return for their balcony and dogs.I loved the food here!  The atmosphere was really nice as well.  I followed everyone's reviews and got the white trash fries and chose a Guinness dog. The white trash fries were good, but be prepared for A LOT!  There is no description on what is on them so think dumped nachos but on French fries. It was a bit much for me, and I tried my husbands cheddar bacon ranch fries and THOSE were good.  I added andouille sauce, creole mustard, and fill relish to my dog and that was just about perfect.  Everything complemented the next.
I got one drink, their drink of the day, (a dirty cat or something?) and it was decent. 
Overall, I will definitely go back and try other new things, but I'd recommend giving the cheddar bacon fries some credit .We've been living in NOLA for almost a year now and tonight we finally had the opportunity to try Dat Dawg- I wish we hadn't!
First, as several people have mentioned, they only take cash. We had cash on us tonight, but that is a rare occurrence. In this day and age- just pay the 2% and take plastic already!
Second, the prices for hot dogs are way high. $7.50, and no this does not include fries or chips. Fries will set you back another $3.50 - $5.00. 2 Dawgs and 2 fries with a glass of water cost $25.00. That is WAY overpriced!
Third, let's talk about the food. This meal is one of 3 I can ever remember in my entire life throwing away. Yes, THROWING AWAY!!! I ordered the "veggie Dog" with a variety of toppings on the side. What they do not mention is that they do not serve veggie dogs, they serve a cheap Boca Burger cut up and shoved into a hot dog bun. As a person who loves Veggie dogs and hates Boca style veggie burgers, I was really surprised to receive a disgusting pre-frozen burger when I ordered a veggie dog. What the heck??? If nothing else, completely different condiments are used for a burger verses a dog. I took 2 bites and tossed the cheap flavorless mess. I also ordered fries with bacon, cheese and ranch. Those were fine and a large order. I had to toss half of them. My partner had a Guiness dog and fries. He thought the taste of it was fine, but nothing special and it was small and overpriced by about $3.
We will not be back and I don't understand why this place has such high ratings. Is food in the Big Easy really so bad that this place qualifies as good??Don't let the casual atmosphere fool you. It was a quiet Sunday afternoon and Dillon made us absolutely gorgeous and perfect Old Fashioned cocktails. He was very helpful, sharing recommendations for places to continue our culinary and libatious (is that a word?) journey through NOLA. Thank you Dillon! The Sea Dog (deepfried cod) the Werewolf and the Bacon Cheddar Ranch fries were so so good. Seriously. Just right. The afternoon sun was slanting in, the weather had just started cooling off for the late afternoon / early evening. So glad we popped in.German beef brat with mayo, onions,  tomatoes,  and the fries with chili,  yes please. Puppies loved coming out to eat, and even the temperature didn't deny us a warm spot out in the sun.Come here for a specialty dog, duck or rhe turducken. I personally loved the duck special! Great view from th e balcony too!My SO got Dat Dog during a recent trip to New Orleans.  We were there on a Thursday at 9pm.  We are both non-meat eaters so we both got vegan "Chef Choices".  I would recommend just building your own as the chefs the night we were there didn't seem to give much thought to our "Chef Choice" dogs.  I really do appreciate all of the the vegetarian/vegan options here and I think you could get a great hot dog (meat or veggie based) here...but maybe just build you own :-)
Keywords: Vegan, VegetarianIf you want a hot dog, this is where you should go. Of course, they are still just hot dogs.
Lots of options, but for all the money you spend, it is still just as satisfying as a hot dog.
Did I mention that they have hot dogs?
This is a hot dog restaurant.
It takes surprisingly long to get a hot dog in this place, all things considered.We stopped here one day after work and I was amazed at the different variations of hot dogs they have. This is my new favorite hot dog place. They even have a vegan hot dog that's delicious! I highly recommend you try this place. The hot dogs are fantastic. You will walk away wondering how you ever went through life without eating at this place!I had a bite of a couple of the different dogs and they were all kinds of awesome.  (I had already eaten and my friends were kind enough to provide a hot dog sampler). I'm not really even sure exactly what was on them but I will certainly be back next time I'm in NOLA. The upstairs area has a balcony to sit outside and listen to the live jazz   The drinks were ridiculously affordable too. I grabbed a vodka soda and it was only $5.The decor of the place has a summer like atmosphere. Very colorful and cool garage doors that welcome in any passerby. When there is good weather, you can sit outside at one of the many picnic tables or you can sit inside, watch the game and grab a beer.
With that said, the food is delicious. The buns they use are not buns. I'm not certain exactly what it is, but it's like a thick piece of bread cut in the middle in shape of a bun. That too, is delicious. I'm a very plain jane kind of person so I just get the beef dog with ketchup on it. The presentation of the food is very good. They do a zig zag with the ketchup and sprinkle some green ingredients (this is why I don't cook). The fries are really good too. They're a bit on the spicy side. They have a zest and a crunch to them. Most places don't really spend too much time on the fries to make them taste good, but kudos to Dat Dog for that.
With that said, the only feedback I have is the fact that it takes practically five minutes a person to order. I dread coming here on a really busy day because I'll have to invest an hour or more to be there on a busy day. They usually only have one person running the register. I really hope they sign up for the Square service soon so they can take debit cards/credit cards. It would speed up the line. The customer service is very friendly though. They all seem hardworking and will go beyond the customers expectation.Great price for a quick, and delicious bite. My friends and I loved Trivia Night (Tuesdays around 7:30 pm), and will definitely be making many appearances to hopefully win the free pitcher of beer one week.Very eclectic place to enjoy your hot dog. They have many different hot dogs to choose from along with different types of toppings. They have balcony seating outside which is definitely a must do. The food was really good the service is quick they have a full-service bar upstairs as well the prices were perfectDelicious! Great view and super quick order! Get a spot on the balcony. You won't be disappointed!We had lunch here last weekend while visiting NOLA to move our freshman daughter into her dorm at Tulane University. It was a fun experience! Also, I enjoyed reading about the history of the restaurant on their website, very inspirational!
The selection of hot dogs (alligator?!) and unlimited/interesting toppings (no extra charge) and fries (Anna's White Trash?!) was interesting and delicious. I had the smoked German bratwurst with olive salad and creole mustard. My unadventurous husband had a plain beef dog with mustard. We shared an order of plain fries and we each got a fountain drink.
The only thing keeping me from giving Dat Dog five stars is the cost. Two dogs, one order of fries and two drinks cost us $26-27. Not as affordable as you'd expect for a student hang-out near campus. But definitely worth an occasional visit!My Vegan Review: Stopped by one night and had their Vegan Sausage  Its was really good. Their bread is also Vegan. The nice gentlemen behind the counter told me once I asked about their Vegan dogs. Had their fries as well.
Cool little place right there on Frenchmen St. After checking out some bands stop by and grab a dog.I wish a Dat Dog could be in Los Angeles! This place is awesome and the food is absolutely delectable. I hope you come hungry because you will leave happy. Make sure to pair your dog with a local craft beer... can't go wrong with an IPA or a blonde.I have driven by this place many times and heard all my friends talk about it. So today I decided to check it out.
When I went up to order I noticed quite an extensive variety of dogs to chose from. I had a an alligator sausage dog. It was Quite fantastic so were the cheese fries. I also noticed they have a full bar with a great selection of beer. They got an outdoor projector so you can catch the game while you are eating your food.
While this place does have a lot of wonderful things it does have a few bad ones. One thing is that the prices are too expensive. Another thing was trying to hear the guy yelling out my name over a really loud crowd of people. Other than that it is still worth it to go in my opinion.
In short this is a fantastic place to get a good dog with all the works but be prepared to pay a little more than normal.Awesome great fun place with amazing dogs and beer! Loved this place. The atmosphere is super fun and the people that work there are very energetic.
If and when I come back to visit I definitely will come here again.
I highly recommend this place.Yessss... they serve Field Roast vegan dogs--my favorite brand! You get to pick your dog, then choose from a wide & unlimited array of toppings and condiments. They're open late, too, so this makes the perfect drunk food.
I had the smoked apple sage vegan dog with chipotle mayo, mustard, mother-in-law slaw, pico de gallo, and jalapenos, plus a side of seasoned fries. My friend got the kielbasa dog. We were both impressed with our respective orders.. 
The fries are awesome--super crispy with a bold flavor. I'd love to know what sort of spices they use. The spicy toppings complimented the veggie dog quite well, and I demolished the thing in the space of two minutes. My only complaints? The bun, while soft and fresh, was a bit skimpy, and I'd have liked more slaw.
It was busy the night we came, but we didn't have to wait overly long. We sat upstairs on the gallery, and watched the drunken revelers staggering about Frenchman Street. Fun place; great meal; would definitely return.We had more fun here than the stuffy fancy jazz club down the street. Stopped for a quick bite before grabbing the street car back to the hotel. There are jazz clubs on this entire street and the best show was from this balcony. Across the street was a 10 piece brass band of local kids jamming in the street. Played everything from Rick James to classic jazz. People literally dancing in the street in the rain to their music. We ate the best hot dogs ever and enjoyed a free concert and felt like we witnessed NOLA at its most natural essence: wet and wild.Perfect hood coffee shop ...lovely staff ...wonderful baked goods & yum breakfast. Coffee variations are delicious & sooo tasty. Espresso strong & oily ...def a pick me up. Relax inside or outside ...i'll be back regularly even if it will not be around the corner of my house anymore.The bacon werewolf and wtf fries were ok. Nothing special and actually way too salty. Plus, it was super busy and the order took like 20 minutes to come out. Definitely not worth your money or time.This is my favorite restaurant in new Orleans. I love the guiness sausage more than anything on the planet. They have good prices and I've always had a good experience with them. Try the white trash fries, you won't be sorry.Great spot to cap off a night out on Frenchman Street! These are some hearty dogs, too!! And if you're not completely decided on if you're done for the night, this place serves beer as well.  It's a win win!Oh what a wonderful place to stop after a few drinks.  Music was playing right outside. The dogs were delicious and I can't begin to describe the bacon ranch fries... to die for.  A couple libations might have influenced my taste buds but as a hot dog lover I would go back in an instant.Everything was bomb!
Duck sausage / blackberry sauce / cole slaw / onions / mustard - to die for combo. The duck flavor wasn't super prevalent, but still best hot dog I've ever had (and I wasn't even very drunk when I ate it). 
Slovenian sausage / andouille sauce / blue cheese - the slovenian sausage has a different flavor (similar to kielbasa?) and you'll need mints afterwards  - especially with this topping combo but it was real good. I wasn't crazy about the andouille sauce (the texture/color were a little weird) but it complemented the sausage nicely
Also, get fries. Any fries.This place is awesome! Stayed next door for a few days and ate her several time- Upstairs bar is cool- Hans is the man with the plan- every suggestion was spot on! Definitely go see Hans!Great food, quick and friendly service, fun balcony! I'm kinda obsessed with the GBLT I ordered for lunch. I'll definitely come back.Dat Dog was not amazing, it was good but not amazing. I got the crawfish sausage with crawfish étouffée and it was good. we also got étouffée fries which were good as well. This place is so casual, and there is a bar. I would say try Dat Dog atleast once when visiting NOLA, I personally would not want to go again but I'm really glad I tried it!We were in the area a few weeks back and decided to stop here for dinner. We had spent a good part of the day walking the French Quarter and Marigny and we were starving. 
It was a Saturday night at dinner time and it was on the busy side. There are two doors to get in and it was a bit confusing as to whether you seat yourself or wait to be seated. There were people mulling around for to go orders and it was a bit disorganized.
We eventually grabbed a table that became available. Someone came and took the previous inhabitant's empty baskets and trash away, but they never wiped down the table. We had to do our best to clean it on our own some.
I ordered the crawfish sausage with crawfish etoufee on top. My boyfriend got the alligator sausage. He wasn't sure what to top it with so the waiter suggested letting the chef surprise him. So, he did. They brought his out and it had bacon, onions and blackberry jam topping it. We were very skeptical about the blackberry jam all over it, but it was actually very good. I think mine was a little better, but I would recommend both.
Despite the messiness and disorganization, I would definitely come back. The staff was nice and the food was very good.I've been here twice.....it is awesome (and I don't even like hot dogs)
First thing....the location (burgeoning Freret) will capture your imagination of the inclusive arrogance of "our New Orleans" Uptown.  Then, the restaurant's Dr.Bob bottlecap art-styled deco inside and non-stop soundtrack of hits will set you in a playful positive mood.  It must be infectious because all the staff carry the same attitude and take pride in what they provide for customers.  It certainly helps that most of the staff are young coeds....
I've had a basic German with relish and mustard and chilli cheese fries (serving of fries could feed a family) and nearly melted when tasting the combination of the sourdough bun with the sausage.  It triggers an endorphine-fueled taste bud euphoria. I certainly didn't expect a hot dog (a freaking hot dog) to reach flavor this potent
One other time I parlayed the "Chef's Choice" which turned into a crawfish sausage, smothered in crawfish etouffee, mustard, tomatoes, onions, and mayo. It compels you to slow down and bask in the rich flavors they can deliver.
Can't say enough positive things about this place and it will always leave you in a good moodFood was awesome. Service was so-so. (Waiter kept forgetting drinks!) Fun balcony looking over Frenchmen St. We both had the same thing: Guiness dog? Yum.So besides the staff leaving something to be desired...the food was really good. They have a speciality drink on the menu they can no longer fnd the liquor for....but I really did enjoy the food it was worth the tripIt's near Tulane! I can go there instead of our canteen...We tried alligator dog and crawfish dog...kinda oily but it's real sausage...also with some good cheese fries...taste good...I ordered a veggie dog and got a packaged Garden Burger cut in half, singed, and placed on a hot dog bun. The toppings were skimpy. Now that just hurts my feelings!
Dat Dog, let me love you! You're a cool spot and I like the indoor-outdoor thing you have going on. If you start serving *legitimate vegetarian hot dogs,* not hard to find and offered in most grocery stores, I'm glad to re-review. If you just want to serve the pure colon carcinogens, then own that, too, and take the "veggie dog" option off the menu. But don't tease me.The Louisiana Sausage with andule sauce was delicious!  The chilli cheese fries have a certain Cajun spice very good.  I would definitely take a minute to try this place if you are in the area.  Inexpensive, filling, and a great vibe.You can build your own dog or burger or cod fish!! they even have vegetarian options! :) they have a full bar of course and beers on tap. This place is so good I would come again, pretty much all the meals are $7.95. Definitely worth it!!Dat Dog is amazing. Sure, the price maybe higher than what you think a hot dog should cost and the wait maybe longer than you want, but the outcome - a hell of a way to spend lunch. Their variety of hot dogs and sausages, the numerous free toppings, the delicious toasted buns; this is no Lucky Dog my friend. I suggest dropping by late in the afternoon to avoid the serious crowds, order up a dog and some chili cheese fries to share (sooo good!), grab a Barq's and find a seat outside and relax. Your food will get there and it will be delicious. I can't wait until they move across the street to the bigger space. Remember - CASH ONLY.Dat Dog keeps it simple, with just meat on buns, fries, and drinks making up the menu. But oh what meat it is. For the traditional dog, you get a choice of German beef or pork wieners. The rest is a United Nations of sausage that includes bratwurst from Germany, Polska kielbasa, Slovenian sausage, and local alligator and smoked sausages. Nary a beak or claw was to be found: This was quality sausage. The buns are big to hold the range of condiments offered. I'm pretty sure the chili was homemade, dark with cumin. Other offerings include sauerkraut, onions, relish, multiple mustards, wasabi, guacamole, and andouille sauce. The cheese fries (one order is enough for at least 2 people, probably more) involved real cheese and not squirted cheese-like product, were crispy, and had a nice spice to them. The spouse, whose time overseas involved a great deal of European sausage sampling, gave both the traditional German beef dog and the Slovenian sausage thumbs up. At $5/$6 each, the dogs might be pricey for some, but one is enough for a meal and the quality is high. The only down part of the experience was running out of soda before I had finished my fries and the inane conversation of the sorority girls at the next table. 
Things to know: seating is minimal inside and out, they're cash only, and they're closed on Mondays.Had a plain pork dog, fries (with creole seasoning) and a fountain drink.  Fries were good, and the hot dog was ok.  I think they're a bit overpriced, 15 bucks and cash only, which isn't convenient for me.I really like Dat Dog, and have found myself craving it on the regular.  I usually get the smoked german brat and it is awesome.  Had the keilbasa once and didn't love it, but that could just be preference.
Would love if they suggested creative/tasty ways to dress the crawfish or gator dogs differently than a regular sausage. I'm never really sure what would work best on those.
Also would be awesome if you could get some greens with the meal instead of fries as the only choice.  Would be there WAY more often for that.
Will definitely be returning soon! ps- the fries are deliciousGo hungry because portions are huge and plan on talking a walk after. I love the crawfish "hotdog" (more like sausages) withy crawfish étouffée. To-die-for. 
Husband sweats by the alligator with a simple squirt of mustard.Alligator sausage? Chili cheese fries? I've died and gone to Joe Dirt heaven! Delicious.
Being from Minneapolis - which was recently voted the Number One Hipster City by some self-righteous rating company - I'm always surprised to see hipsters when I travel to another city. I mean, face it, Minneapolis had hipsters long before your city did.
While visiting New Orleans, a local friend recommended Dat Dog. When we were walking up, I saw it all - skinny jeans! Handlebar mustaches! Unshaved pits on girls! Ink on every body part that you can imagine! It was a beautiful sight.
We walked inside, and became completely overwhelmed by the options - dogs could be swamp dogs (made of alligator), chorizo, beer bratwurst, and a whole host more. 
When you go to the counter,  be prepared to know what you want. This is not the kind of place you dawdle and decide at the counter. Well, it can be, but just know that the people behind you will definitely roll their eyes at you behind your back and talk about you later.
PROTIP: Beware if someone says that they recommend the sausage then casually glance downward. They're not talking about the dogs.
I had a swamp dog (alligator sausage) with ranch bacon fries. It was to die for. My heart couldn't stand eating at this place daily, but if I lived nearby, it would definitely be on my regular go-to list.I shall buck the norm and declare a 3-star rating. I know, shocking right? But everyone else gave it a 4.5. I know.
Actually, I would be willing to give it a 4, but this is based on a ONE time experience. I enjoyed it and would recommend this. I just have some reservation.
But let me first start off with what I ordered. I had the Louisiana cajun dog with everything (wasabi, onions, chili, bacon, cheddar, the works...) I don't recommend getting getting everything on it b/c although it is a of fresh, solid ingredients, you can't throw everything on it and expect it to be delish. 
I also ordered the bacon-ranch, cheddar fries. They provided a large base of fries ($3.25). They had ample bacon bits; a small amount of ranch; and the fries were the slightly cajun-ed type...BUT the weird thing is, it did not impress me at all. Man, Rally's serves a better version of this and it's supposed to be the same thing. Don't get me wrong, it wasn't bad (more like average), but when you throw that mix together, it should be the bomb-diggity. 
Overall, nice experience. Nice seating area -- outside in the sun but under the umbrella shade. Cool breeze (for New Orleans at least during the spring). I did order a bottle coke so I was a bit parched after I exasperated by defined quantity of sugar and water (I prefer a fountain drink b/c it is New Orleans and there is a thing call heat and humidity, but that fountain version should be coming along once they officially open their new side). 
So why not a 4-star? It easily has the potential to exceed that, but I am going to wait until my next dog, I mean, dat-dog.The only reason this doesn't get five stars is because of the day after. Nearly killed me but dear lord were the fries and dogs amazing! Dig in!Yes!!! I found myself closing my eyes when I was chewing. I'm from Dallas but I'm a bit obsessed with a movie (mr right) that was filmed in New Orleans. Me and the hubby came down specifically to visit some of the places from the movie. I was expecting to fall in love with a hot dog. But I did!! The bread is amazing! The wiener simply delicious. The fries. The homemade chili that I topped everything with. All of it was memorable. We really enjoyed ourselves. Met some new people and added a new favorite to our travels. Thank you Dat Dog.I have been to the restaurant on Freret a couple of times.  I have been ordering an Italian sausage dog with sauerkraut and they are very good.  My only complaint is that they put very little sauerkraut on it.  I mean like a table spoon.  Please, please make your portions bigger!!!Hard to say this, but as a proud Chicagoan, this place has the best dogs I've EVER had (including Hot Doug's in Chi-town - I know, I went there). A more evolved wiener and taste selection plus fantastic bread just slap any notion of you thinking you know hot dogs to the wayside. Give them the heavyweight title and hang it on the wall.Pretty good hot dogs...I think it's the bread more than anything.  Service was ok....not 100% but ok. Good for going somewhere with kids.  My son enjoyed all of the colors on the outside seating.  Pretty fun place.  Slightly overpriced for a hot dog though.Well worth the price and many choices of "dogs". I just got the traditional beef weiner with chili and cheese and shared the side order of fries....they were HUGE. and delicious of course. My boyfriend got the crawfish sausage which made me want more! Next time I go I'll try a fancier dog. Definitely a spot for hot dog/sausage lovers!!Dat Dog is a great place for a casual lunch or dinner with friends. I bring my friends down from out of town, and they have a really good time. Also, it has free trivia every Tuesday, and that's a lot of fun. The other reason for this review is that they have great customer service. I had a bad experience involving an app that did not work recently, and I left with a really sour taste in my mouth. Both the director of marketing and COO reached out to me to apologize for/remedy the experience. They really went beyond my expectations, and it was a really classy gesture.Good hotdog place. They have a three different vegan hot dogs. They have an outdoor porch that would be good in the winter.holy crap was this the best hot dog I've ever had.
be brave and opt for chefs choice.  TRUST ME, they know what they are doing.
I got the Alligator sausage with a boatload of toppings ranging from avocado and pico de gallo to the andouille sauce. it was off the charts.
HUGE outdoor patio area if you don't mind the humidity.
and if you have the stomach capacity for it, get some of the fries. sort of NoLa Poutine. Loved the ranch and the etouffee fries equally.
can't believe this started as just a stand across the street. one year in and it's going VERY strong. this will become a NoLa institution. no question.They sell hot dogs. Only hotdogs. +1 for that. 
They have creative dogs - not really my thing, and multiple toppings -  which I dig. 
2 chili cheese dogs. 1 original beef, 1 Guinness dog for the boy, and a side of fries to share. 
-The dogs appear grilled (on a griddle not a grill) not boiled or steamed - on a grill is the only way to go in my opinion.  The Guinness dog was a bit burnt in spots.   
-The beef dog was only room temp (not even warm enough to melt the cheese on the bun). Leading me to believe it was precooked. The chili was also only room temp. Cold shredded cheese is not OK. 
-The Guinness dog was sweet and indeed tasted like Guinness.  
-The chili was ok. not bad not great. 
-The bun was a bit excessive. Nice that they toasted it, but just too much bread for my liking, I cut a bit off and ate around it. 
The fries are large enough to share and are coated or double fried. They have that Rally's thing going on. You know what I'm talking about...but they were overcooked. Leaving dry hard fries. No bueno. 
Overall I wasn't impressed but where else are you going to grab a quick hotdog?I love this place. A ton of options, and a lot of different meat choices.
The owner is usually behind the register and is very nice.
Only con is that the don't take credit cards.Glorious goodness!!! I love the simplicity of this heavenly place. Walk past all the picnic tables to the bar area inside, there's a chalk board to your left, pick your dog (meat, seafood, and veggie options) and pick your toppings (I suggest the crawfish étouffée and cheese)! That's it! And the fries are a fantastic side!! Costs less than $15 a person for a decked out dog, fries, and a drink. Oh and be prepared- CASH ONLY which is weird and inconvenient but the food makes up for it!Honestly I love Dat Dog, I live just a couple blocks up the road and I'm in there all the time. Tuesday Trivia Night is dope. 
But they need a new TV. I used to go watch the Saints games on Sundays, and halfway through football season their only outdoor TV (which was big and nice) broke and there was some weird discoloration in the bottom half. I thought it would be fixed, let the super friendly staff know about it. Nothing happened. It's been like that for over 6 months now. You'd think that a place that is geared towards live tv events like Dat Dog would prioritize having something passable to watch live tv on.Certainly not the place to go if you're looking for an haute-cuisine dining experience but for what it is this place can't be beat.
I stopped in for a quick lunch and will return every time I'm in New Orleans.
Great atmosphere, good selection of cold draft beer and super friendly, efficient staff.
I had a dog smothered in crawfish etouffee ............AMAZING!Knew this place since it first opened up on Freret and watched as it grew into a money grubbing machine. Sure, the hotdogs are tasty. But can you believe they charge you $9 for a hot dog and $4 for a soda? People are such fools for thinking this place is "legit" and a "find" in Nola. Somebody care to explain why its cash only? Because people never have cash these days and they conveniently have an ATM with a $3 surcharge. I guarantee they make a killing from that alone. You just dropped $16 on a $5 lunch buddy!
And I knew two guys who worked there and the management treats employees like crap. The founder, a former Tulane professor who drives a really nice old school white Mercedes, seems like a nice enough guy, but I really hate the way this place is conducting itself. 
Scam, don't let yourself get "just a little" ripped off for a "taste of DAT new orleans flava yall!". Everything about this place is fake and about money.
EDIT: They now accept cards so I gave them an extra star.
