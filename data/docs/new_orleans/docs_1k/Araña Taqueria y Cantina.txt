I really wanted to like this place. Margaritas were decent but the food was pretty bland. Nothing exciting (particularly when we went with the waiter's picks of must have). This place really nice to step up their game if the want to last in NOLA amongst all the other amazing restaurants in town.Never again....authentic mexican....no
Best thing about this place was the drinks...they do have good drinks. 
I'd skip this place and head to el gato any day.Great stop for HH -- half price tacos and margaritas. What more can you ask for? The staff is wonderful but the place can get pretty packed. Some tacos were better than others (grilled fish, lengua, chipotle shrimp and fried shrimp were favorites at the table, while Baja fish was the definite loser). Margaritas are delicious (have around 5 seasonal flavors), and their other drinks are nice and stiff. I don't know if I'd venture out of my way if it wasn't HH honestly because they are a bit expensive otherwise, but would come back for HH in a heartbeat.The most average of meals on a street with dozens of great places.  The service was actually below average - unfriendly, inattentive and sparse.  The taqueria doesn't serve chips automatically like most places - you have to order them with salsa or guac. The guac was far from fresh - tasted like it had been sitting out all day. The shrimp in tacos were overcooked and uninspired.  Restaurants in New Orleans are supposed to know how to serve shrimp. Do yourself a favor and pick one of the other fine places on Magazine - I'm sorry we didn't !Ridiculously awesome tacos and drinks, exacerbated by the fact that they were 1/2 price between 3 and 7. Great service and great local atmosphere. Highly recommend.Excellent bar. Good food. Attentive servers. Wonderful hip decor. A great value. Especially at happy hour. STOP comparing this place to Rum House. If you want a good taco minus the backwards baseball caps and LSU T shirts then Arana is the place to go.We tried this on a Saturday afternoon and figured this would be a good place for some authentic tacos. This is not that spot. Drinks were ok and we did order tacos. However, for what we order the bill was a bit steep. The ambiance is great but that's essentially what you're paying for. Unfortunately, it has been a while since we've gone back but we've chalked this up to a place for "hipster" crowd who is mostly drinking and snacking in a nice environment--not street tacos.Great tostado and perfect for Sunday brunch. I had the bottomless margarita. Small restaurant but very cool looking. They have the best pickled slaw- def ask for this!We went during happy hour, excellent drunken horchatas and Mexican sliced punch. The El Pastor tacos were great and the queso fundido with in house made chorizo was delicious. We're from Vegas and have eaten at some of the best places. This little place on Magazine St knows what they're doing.I was going to give this place a 3.5 until the third of three tacos fell apart in my hand because the tortilla was so stale and dry. The shrimp smelled fishy, the fish was a lump instead of strips, and the carne asada was on the chewy side. Then I decided a 2.5 was more than adequate, until I realized Yelp only allows whole digit ratings. In my estimation, a simple, fresh, flavorful taco is the bare standard of quality for a Mexican/Latin American restaurant. Freshness is perhaps the most important quality, and the tortilla is the foundation. Fail this, and you lose all credibility.. Otherwise, the bad club scene music and TV's playing sports are an undesirable cultural distraction, and the bathrooms weren't clean, which in my experience says something about the cleanliness of the kitchen. A 2.0 rating seems just about right.Not only does this place have a killer happy hour, but it's one of the few places in the city that can cook tongue properly. Tongue tacos are amazing and I've never had a bad experience here. Recommend!If I could give it a -5 review I would. My boyfriend visited the establishment for a late lunch 4/25/18 and we were seated outside upon arrival. However after receiving menus from the waiter and seated outside he NEVER came back to our table. Keep in mind there were only two other tables seated outside and one inside. Fast forward 15 minutes and a couple enters the restaurant with a child and my boyfriend asks me to observe the waiter's response to the table. I observed the table receiving menus and water within two minutes. I proceeded to enter the place to voice my concerns in regards to the service and the waiter stated, "I'm sorry it's just bad communication." He never tried to rectify the matter. Needless to say I will not return after being so excited to try the place.The chips, salsa and guacamole was good, probably a 7 or 7.5. However, I can't say the same for the food. The chef tried to do this new type of "infusion" which makes the food um-eatable. Pickled tacos, not sure that's even a "thing". The open face chicken tamale was luke warm and simply not good. Service was excellent and our waiter was personable and super friendly, just wish the food matched the excellent service!I really enjoyed myself here. The staff was very friendly. I went during brunch for bottomless margaritas. The margarita is very tasty and strong, not watered down as you would think when they serve them bottomless. I ordered the quesadilla with chicken and it was tasty. The salsa we got spicy, but for me personally, it was a tad too spicy. My friend enjoyed it though. The restaurant itself was on the smaller side but in a great location next door to the bull dog. Definitely a top brunch destination for me!The owner contacted me after reading my Yelp review. He was very receptive to constructive criticism and not defensive at all. His restaurant is his baby and he wants to make sure everything is perfect when he is there and when he is not. He immediately addressed my criticisms and everything is perfect again. I definitely recommend Arana for their delicious food, awesome happy hour, people watching and a great location on Magazine Street. Thank you Rich for taking the time to connect with your customers! You're the best!This place is phenomenal! From the tacos to the enchiladas, the entradas to the daily tamale, you can't go wrong. Without a doubt try whatever tamale they have for the day, 9 times out of 10 it is spot on, and even on that off day it's still pretty darn delicious. Not too many places can you throw a dart at the menu, take a chance at something new and enjoy it with little to no hesitation!!
Oh, and the staff are as kind and personable as can be! Always an added bonus!Disappoinement.  Decent atmosphere.  I hear the drinks are good.  
Service decent.  But the food was tasteless, bland, & dry.  Overall $$ expensive for what it offers.  Probably appeals to the post-college crowd.  But won't last long in my opinion.....We come here often- great happy hour mon-fri 3-7, 1/2 price drinks and tacos.  Great margaritas, great tacos, great service.Probably my new favorite happy hour spot. 3-7 with half price margaritas and tacos. 
People need to stop with the comparison to Rum House, it's a false equivalency. The space is great and has a nice vibe. Our server, Isaac, was attentive but not overbearing and very genuine, which I feel is a rarity with servers in our fair town.  
My strawberry margarita was delicious, not too sweet with muddled strawberries. I had the Baja fish and carne asada tacos, my husband had the al pastor and pibil tacos The best tacos ever? No, but at HH prices, generously portioned and a tasty treat. My biggest complaint? The tortillas aren't up to par and tacos should be double tortilla-ed, otherwise you end up with torn taco syndrome.
Araña probably needs time to find it's footing, but I think it's got a nice foundation and we'll definitely be back to try more.Salty chips, salty steak fajitas, awful pork. Flan was inedible. Won't be back. Cute place though.This place is incredible. By far the best Mexican food in the south. The margaritas and perfect and the wait staff is fast and courteous. We walked in on a whim on a Sunday morning and I cannot believe how amazing the Chilaquiles with pibil (slow roasted pork) was. The tostada with its pickled slaw was also refreshing and perfect for a hot New Orleans day. This is an absolute must for anyone looking to try something outside of creole cooking food on Magazine.Came here Saturday. Waitress was excellent (girl with dreads).
Food still poorly executed for Mexican standards. I'd suggest that if they insist on serving bag tortillas, just make the order of three tacos to maybe add "value". But $5 a taco seems steep for what you get. 
I ordered the carne asada salad, tasted great but seems more of an appetizer than a meal portion. May I suggest maybe chopping the lettuce.
Location still is awesome.My friends and I decided to go to their happy hour before the saints game. It was beyond slammed for their half off tacos and drinks. Their house margarita was very delicious. I would order all of their tacos again except for the fried chicken and buttermilk taco. It was over fried to a crisp. The queso and chips were delish! The waiter was very nice, but had many tables to work with that day. He was supposed to split our check for couples, but then the system did not let him. So we had to sit there for a bit calculating everything up. But with as busy as he was, he always made sure we were doing well!Delicious, reasonably priced, very friendly waitstaff. Strongest margaritas on Magazine St. My wife confirms!!The service was good. The drunken horchata was amazing, as was the veggie option taco (though it needed to be doubled layered because it fell apart). I was disappointed with the spicy shrimp - hardly anything in it. They have a great happy hour deal of half off drinks and tacos, from 3-7p. Go then!!!For a city that doesn't have very good Mexican food, Arana is a nice addition.  That being said, it's still working out some of the kinks.  We ate there on a Friday night during happy hour.  Whoever sat us decided not to speak to us...simply to point and throw menus on the tables, which was weird in a place that small and that crowded. We ordered chips and salsa and they were out of chips. I ordered a glass of Vinho Verde and they were out. About half way through sitting there, someone walked in with a giant container of bleach and went into the back.  The entire restaurant (which is not very big) smelled like bleach for a good 10 or 15 minutes. This might be the fault of the people sitting next to us, but it sure was loud.  I had to ask our poor waiter to repeat everything two or three times. However, the tacos were good and you can't beat the happy hour prices. Our waiter ended up bringing us some chips and salsa on the house and if you check in on facebook, you get a free dessert.  The bill for two people ended up being $15 and the waiter was great.  I can excuse the learning curve they're clearly going through.  I'll definitely try this place again and hopefully they'll have everything on the menu.Guacamole was good but their hot salsa is top shelf. Baka fish taco (**** stars) and most filling.  Lengua and nopales look plain (**** stars) but are tender and tasty.  Nopales could use some braised tomato and onion to finish them off.  The pastor was a bit dry (*** stars) the mole tacos taste better on flour tortilla (*** stars) baja shrimp taco was (***** stars) main event today.  They have a 3-7 happy hours where all menu tacos and drinks are half off.  Parking is always a bear here but the staff and chefs are friendly and available.  They offer aguas that's they turn into margaritas which are great as well.  All in all seems like a grey place for lunch brunch or drinks with your pals.Just OK -- food isn't that great and the place isn't that clean. However if you want a Margarita .. the Champagne Margarita is good! They also have pitchers for happy hour pricing .Great margaritas! I recommend the pink rose lemon and the champagne margaritas! Happy hour prices are great. Tacos are small but good. Queso was really delicious but not hot. Had it sent back and it returned the same temperature. But great for happy hour!Awesome service and the open face tamale appetizer was fantastic. Creative and tasty cocktail menu.Araña Taqueria Y Cantina kept showing up in publications all over the city so after reading about the "spider" restaurant many times, decided to try it one weekend.  I love all cuisine Latin inspired so it wasn't a tough sell.  Right in the middle of magazine street, it's a perfect lunch spot.  Food was great, service was great, drinks were great - very enjoyable meal.  Definitely would recommend trying Araña Taqueria Y Cantina.Food was delicious and the Bloody Mary was great, however, there were only two waiters in the whole joint to serve the customers. I feel bad for the waiters but not for management... It's frustrating when you have to wait 15 minutes for your Bloody Mary.Absolutely the Best Authentic Mexican Cuisine you'll ever experience!!! One word Mole' !!!!If you read my reviews, you would know that I almost never write a negative review. My partner and I love to eat, and we are super easy to serve. We went to this place because it was close to a parade, and frankly, because Rum House had a looooong wait. We sat outside, which was lovely. It took forever before our server came out. We ordered the nachos as an appetizer, and Margaritas. Now, the Margaritas are quite strange. They have a weird color, and boy are they sour! The Nachos were meh. Our server forgot us, again, but we finally placed our order, and then waited a bit longer for our food. The place was almost empty, so I don't understand the delays. Now, for the awful part: When our food was served, all four of us noticed that our server's hands and NAILS were filthy. I mean, crusty, foul looking, haven't been washed for days, gross. We almost left then. But, we were hungry, and used tons of hand sanitizer. I am a big girl, and eat almost anything, but this meal was terrible. The tacos were cold and soggy, and the hockey pucks of rice and beans tasted like pure nothing. I kept quiet until my three companions added their opinions, which were similar. I won't return, mainly because of the poor service, and being completely grossed out by our server's lack of cleanliness. I will wait, no matter how long, at Rum House. Yuk.All I can say is PRAISE THE LORD baby jesus for this place! Thank the gods FINALLY there is some amazing Mexican food in this town... FINALLY!  Not only is the food INCREDIBLE and extremely reasonably priced, but the staff is AWESOME-- so friendly and lovely (love that Natalie!) AND the atmosphere is very cool and relaxing.  We had the queso fundido AND the carne asada tacos and fish tacos... I am STILL savoring the delicious, juicy, savory delectableness of that carne asada.  The fish was fried ever so delicately not to overwhelm you with greasiness.  The ingredients were ALL SO FRESH -- you could tell from not only the several layers of flavor that just kept coming, but also from the fact that I PIGGED out hard and still didn't feel disgustingly full-- a sure sign of quality food!    The amazing Chef Richard came out and talked to us when we were all ooo-ing and aw-ing and drooling all over the place and he was SO delightful and had all the time in the world (despite being busy) to talk with us- AND he sent us a comped tres leches which was TO DIE FOR.
I will be back here every day of my entire life.   I give it 10 million stars.This is a storefront restaurant in the historic Uptown Magazine St. shopping district. The exterior is plain and the interior has a "contemporary Mexican" design. I ordered the Two Tacos Plate (one pork & one ground beef) with two sides (Grilled Mexican Vegetables & Mexican Rice) for $11.00. It was quite delicious and perfectly seasoned. I would recommend this place and would go again. RJTStopped in b/c their sign advertised $2margs and come on, who can resist that??
We had chips and queso, fajitas, and margaritas. What better way to start your new year. I also had coquito ( Puerto Rican egg nog)- I was impressed they had it. I don't know that I've ever seen it out before. It was ok. I forgot traditionally it has egg yolk in it so it wasn't going to be 100% authentic. And I'm used to it being mostly 151.
We had good meals, good service, and good drinks in a welcoming atmosphere. What else could you ask for?Great food. Great atmosphere. Friendly and knowledgeable service. Easy on the Washingtons. What more can you ask for?It was just okay.  I had the chicken enchiladas.  I thought they were small.  Flavor was okay.  Nothing to brag about.  Not saying that  I will never go there again but I am in no rush!The excellent happy hour at Arana bumps this taco joint from a 3-star to a 4-star review.
I recently made my first trip and I'll probably be back at some point. And probably before 7:00, when happy hour ends. Half off drinks and tacos?! Hard to beat that.
My wife and I met up with a friend. We had a pitcher of margaritas and a couple of other drinks. Some guac and queso for the table. And then wife and I each had 3 tacos. All of this came out to less than $60 for the two of us (and just under $30 for our other friend). We all left full and happy, which is exactly the point.
And the drinks aren't watered down, either. In fact, they're quite strong. The girls needed go-cups for theirs and I wasn't drinking too heavily because I had to drive. Next time, I'm taking an Uber!
This space has been several different restaurants in the last few years. I hope Arana and it's great happy hour will be here to stay.I was here with a large group (20 people) and the service was terrible. To begin, it took 15 minutes for the waiter to even approach the table to ask about drinks and appetizers. Then, when we finally put our food orders, half the table got their food first and we're basically done when the other half got their food. Also, they had a hard time splitting check and it took a very long time. They also did not have a good dessert for a birthday celebration. The food was fine but the service was not. I will not go back.One of the best in the city for cocktails. My fav was the jalapeño pineapple cilantro margarita. The bartender was pretty awesome too. As far as the food, I just had the grilled fish tacos which were pretty good. Great service. Great food. Great drinks.Arana offers one of my favorite happy hours! From 3-7 they have half price drinks and tacos. Their Verde salsa is to die for and I like to get extra to put on my tacos! I've never had a taco there that I didn't like but the pibil is my absolute favorite. Do yourself a favor and have a margarita. Even the house margaritas are fabulous, made with fresh lime juice! Do yourself a favor and check this place out!Delicious tacos, and the jalapeño pineapple cilantro margarita is a must. They also have excellent happy hour prices for drinks and tacos. But we were shocked at how embarrassingly small the $11 ceviche was. It tasted delicious, but we all agreed that it would not be something any of us ordered again at this restaurant as many other places around town have equally delicious ceviche in much more reasonable portions for the price.The meat in the tacos was the best I've ever had, with unusual spices. I had Al Pastor, Pibil, and Fish. It was all exceptionally tender and well prepared. We loved the guacamole. Jicama salad was a very nice palate cleanser - great for hot weather.  The margarita pitchers are a great deal during happy hour. Beware - they are stronger than they seem. I'm looking forward to trying the various tequilas - huge flight menu.  It's a funny coincidence we ran into so many people we know there - it's one of those kind of places.  I'm sure you'll run into people you know there too . . . .
Also, our server was very nice.  She was there when it was Byblos too, we remembered.We came here Friday afternoon during happy hour since we needed an outside seat where we could sit with the dog.  Good place and the prices during happy hour are great.  I had a mojito and a margarita, both very good.  The pulled pork taco and the guacamole are amazing.  Our server was also very good, attentive and friendly.  We'll definitely be going back!Honestly, the only reason I'm even giving this place 3 stars is because the service was great. The food was mediocre at best and the drinks were pretty awful. We ordered a top shelf margarita and it was almost undrinkable. Wayyyyy too sweet. Then for an appetizer we ordered the Queso Fundido. Maybe I'm biased because my grandma used to make the best Queso Fundido, but Arana's was pretty lackluster. It was essentially solidified/overcooked cheese and was served with crumbly corn tortillas that were falling apart. We ordered tacos for an entree since they were half off for happy hour and yet again, we were unimpressed. My shrimp taco had 2 pieces of shrimp and is normally EIGHT DOLLARS. Are you kidding me? The fried chicken one had old lettuce and the lengua tacos were way overcooked. I would have probably lost my shit if I would've had to pay full price for our food. All in all, I'd say keep walking down the block and go to Rum House for an amazing Mexican/Carribean fusion experience.IT'S VERY GOOD.
The wife and I came here more than a few months ago and I remember being pleased but not overwhelmed, especially in light of the fact that Taqueria Corona, the best kept secret on Magazine, is right down the street. The food at Arana is not as good as TC, but Arana does have better ambiance and a superior bar. If you're looking for some decent Mexican themed cocktails, this is the place to go.Food is average. I have had better Mexican food in this area. Waiters are nice. Don't order coffee. We had grill fish burrito and shrimp taco. They are good portion of food but a bit on salty side. Anyway it is a good stop if you want to grab a drink and chips, and some simple lunch.Awful service. Got the feeling they did not want us there. Terrible food and drinks. Never again.This place will not be open long unless they completely change everything. The service was slow when there was hardly a soul to be seen. The food was bland...just no flavor at all. It tasted like nothing. The only sides are grilled green onions, rice or beans. I had the onions and beans which were bland and I'm not sure how you are supposed to eat stringy cooked long green onions that won't even cut. We had the house margaritas which were kinda off tasting. They were sourish. Not good at all. Best margaritas are at Juan's and Rum House which are very close by so go there instead.Great specials on Thursdays! Excellent authentic Mexican food. Tried the esquites and nopales tacos for $2 during happy hour, to die for. Quick service and friendly waitstaff. And they bring you free chips while you wait! Definitely a must try in New Orleans, especially if you're a local.The guacamole is fresh and delicious. New Orleans has many Mexican restaurants and there's nothing that sets this one apart. Chicken tinga was bland, service was polite and prompt. 
All in all it's a fine spot, but nothing makes it stand out.While the happy hour prices can't be beat (Half off tacos and drinks) the taste was severely lacking.  Their tortillas are dry and hard to chew.  Unfortunate because the chef and staff were extremely friendly!  Tried their mezcal flight which was interesting.Happy hour is the best in town. Food is amazing and customer service is even better. Magazine Street has a lot of options but you can't go wrong with this place. Highly recommend!!OK so I rated this place with three stars. I wanted to rate it with a 3.6 but definitely not four stars. 
Allow me to explain.
First let me say that this place is happening. It looks cool, very original and is located in the coolest part of town. Can't beat Magazine St. It's hip, not as touristy or cheesy as some parts of town. This place is oozes with Baja California coolness. That's unique for uptown New Orleans.
Now let's talk about the food. We ordered two carne asada tacos, one taco al pastor, one chorizo taco and an order of nachos with beans. 
The tortilla nacho appetizers were great. It came with beans, real Mexican cheese (queso fresco... Not that texmex cheddar crap you get in other places), and with some sort of molé that tasted great. For that dish alone Araña gets passes with flying colors.
The tacos were all nicely plated. Where I felt let down was that they use machine made, bag tortillas. 
I originally ordered lengua tacos but they were out. :(  
The carne asada tacos tasted good but the meat seemed more of a stew then actually grilled beef strips which should be drier; overall it was ok. The taco al pastor was good, but nothing to rave about other than it was pretty. Then last I ordered the chorizo taco which was horrible. Why? It was salty as f#$k! I barely ate. I used the nachos off my appetizer to soften the unbearably salty punch eat bite delivered. 
Here's the thing, if you're a gringo that's never had a street taco with from an illegal Mexican and all you know is Taco Bell or Superior Grill... You might think this is great. Me on the other hand, have savoured mystery meat tacos from non-english speaking illiterate "paisas" that'll put any item off Arana's menu to shame. To add insult to injury, each taco is about $5 for one. Nothing wrong with that if you consider that you're not paying for the taco but for that huge ass spider in the wall. 
Like I said, the place is cool but for a good for a great taco I suggest follow the guys hanging out Home Depot around lunch time.This place is great! if you are looking for a cute and good brunch place this is it. they have $18 bottomless mimosas, margaritas and bloody marys. I ordered the breakfast tostada and it was way better than I expected. The pork was great and plates have a good size!Love this place especially for their generous happy hour from 3-7 pm daily during weekdays. My go to is their pineapple jalapeño margarita and the fajitas. Definitely one of my favorite Mexican restaurants in the city!This place was terrible. The service was decent, during a Saints game so a bit loud, but not bad. The food was really sub par, but the real shock was, after ordering off of a very abbreviated "Brunch" menu, the bill came for $75! We had 2 bloody marys at the "bottomless" for $18 price, 1 bloody mary that was ordered ala carte, chips with queso, and 2 carne asada breakfast burritos. SEVENTY FIVE DOLLARS before tip! The carne asada tasted like they scraped the grill with a dirty brush, and used the charred grease scrapings to season the meat. There was cold pico, scrambled egg and black beans inside this dry breakfast burrito, all of which were devoid of flavor, besides burned grill taste. All of this would not have bothered me that much except when the gotcha bill came. Never again.Popped in to try out the Happy Hour, as Arana is in my new hood. Crystal was the bartender. She answered my questions about drinks and was very helpful. The Happy Hour pricing when I visited was half off tacos and most margaritas. Their modest sized soft tacos are about 5 bucks a piece, so they were $2.50! I got four. They were all good, but the Gringo Taco stood out from the pack (yum)! The Carne (steak) was also very good. The fried chicken (good) and grilled fish (bland) will probably be passed up next time. My half priced jalapeño, pineapple margarita was very, very good, and at $4.50, a steal! All in, my bill before tip was $16! Definitely a deal at Happy Hour! The decor is awesome!!! Big Muerta Mask Spider on the wall!Note: This review is strictly for Arana's margaritas. With that said, I like them!
Made an impromptu stop here during their happy hour, M-F 3-7, where ALL their drinks and tacos are 1/2 off. Decided on a house rocks with salt ($4) and was not disappointed. They aren't too sweet and the lime-salt was great. 
The restaurant atmosphere was lively and they have a few tables outside, but with this summer heat sitting out there during happy hour times may not be very pleasant. 
Service was on-point-- attentive, but not overly done, and friendly. 
Overall, I have to go back soon to give their tacos a try and drown in margaritas!I would have given them three or four stars except they served me rotten fish in the fish tacos. Seriously, only a cook with no sense of smell could not whiff rotten fish. And then you cook it and smells even worse. On top of that, it got past the chef expediting. I would rather have gotten a live (or dead!) cockroach in my food than rotten protein. Cockroach is accidental, bad fish shows that the place is too cheap to toss it and/or hires incompetent cooks. For me, this is the worst thing a kitchen can do. After I complained, they only took off that one taco off the check. Any nice place would have comped my meal. I do like their margaritas, but at $10, them's NYC prices. Authentico Mexicano? No.I can here for our annual friendsgiving and the food was great. The happy hour doesn't end until 7 pm, Monday-Friday, so I was able to get three champagne margaritas in (half price!!) at that time.   We also got some delicious tacos (half price) while we were at happy hour.
We split three salsas, the queso, and the guac. I wasn't really impressed by the guac, the cheese was different (baked cheese and you pulled it apart) and the salsas were just ok.
The service was ok, I was a little disturbed that the bathroom did not have soap in it when I went to the bathroom, but I told our waitress and hopefully she did something about it.  
Overall, I would come back here because it was some pretty decent Mexican food.Celebrating V Day with brunch that has bottomless mimosas, margaritas and bloody Mary's. And probably some tequila.Loved it! Came in for lunch because the R House was packed. Great service, great food. Would definitely go back.The happy hour is a pretty good deal. I tried three tacos: fried chicken, lengua, and carne asada. Next time, I will get 3 fried chicken tacos. I agree with most reviewers that they don't have the best tacos but y'all, the fried chicken one is bangin. If you're in the area during happy hour, go eat all the fried chicken tacos.On a Sunday morning, we opted to drive to the Garden District before making our 2 hour drive home from New Orleans. We stopped in at Arana for brunch. The outside seating had a nice appeal! However, this was the worst experience I have ever had at a restaurant. We ordered off of the brunch menu, and it took almost an hour, only for our plates to come out cold. The amount of time didn't make sense for the number of people in the restaurant. The sandwich my boyfriend ordered came out with burnt cheese and no eggs as it should have. We should have waited the hour wait down the street to be seated instead of coming to this place!!This was the first place we randomly stopped at on Magazine Street in NOLA. The happy hour is ON POINT. Half price drinks and appetizers? Yes!
Had a pineapple jalapeno margarita - so tasty. My favorite though, was the spicy watermelon cooler. That was a stand out, delicious drink - not sweet, very watermelon-y, and very refreshing.
The food was good. Not crazily exceptional, but fresh, well made and tasty. It's worth it to pop in here for a happy hour now and then, sit outside, and watch the goings on at the Breaux Mart across the street.Found this place thru Gambit's summer restaurant guide. Man, it was amazing. The hubby and I are nacho connoisseurs and these are just awesome. Ordered the pork nachos. They came with the most delicious enchilada sauce on them (bonus points)!!  The open face tamale was delicious (no wonder gambit recommended it). We tried a variety of their margarita and tequila based drinks and each one was a winner. Jeff the bartender was great at making recommendations based on what we liked.  We'll definitely be back!Oh man, Rich makes the best black beans.
The chicken mole was so smokey and juicy. Sauce was filled with flavor. Especially liked the addition of roasted pumpkin seeds thrown on top. Everything was warm and presented really well. Took no time at all to arrive. Sitting at the bar, you get great service from their very attentive bar tenders, who make some pretty neat concoctions. BTW there is an excellent tequila list. 
Gotta try the tacos at happy hour, m-f 5-7. Pork tacos are unbeatable. 
The nachos, too, gotta get the nachos. 
The cuisine is distinctly Mexican. Don't expect simple. The flavors are very complex. I really enjoyed the skirt steak too.
Great seating arrangement with unique tables and bar stools. The decor is pretty cool, and atmosphere is really great for groups of friends.
All in all, its the best Mexican cuisine I've had in town.I love this place! Best happy hour in town...3-7 half off all bar can't beat that! Oh not to mention the best bartender Danielle. She is so sweet and helpful. She knows so much about the menu and will help you with your meal at every turn.Pretty much one of the worst meals I have ever had in New Orleans. The guacamole was gross and likely made the day before as it was brown. The tacos were also disgusting....both of us only made it through one bite and we were done. It took serious willpower to swallow that one bite of reheated frozen fish. Also our server spent 30 minutes flirting with the questionable men at the bar instead of attending to the people actually eating in the restaurant. I can't say anything good about this place. Will never go back.Food inspired by the Yucatan with drink prices inspired by New York City with $4.50 Abita Amber, $5.50 Negra Modelo, $8 house margaritas (served in a small glass) and $8 for a glass of sangria. Food service is fast and the flavor of most things is good. The drink prices are too expensive and while the food is good the prices are a bit too much for what you get.  The spider theme of the interior decor is too year round Halloween for this section of town and doesn't seem to contribute anything other than scaring young children. 
My part of the bill came out to $27.16 (before tip) which was for the 3 tacos with 2 sides combo, a shared tamale, an iced tea and one house margarita.  Mexican food is cheap peasant food with most things wrapped in some form of tortilla and no valid reason to be pricey and the same goes for Mexican beer and house margaritas.  There are as good or better Mexican options in the city for a much better value on food and drinks so I'm not confident in the longevity of this place and I probably won't make many return visits.  
Tip: the à la carte seafood tacos are probably one of the better values on the menu.
Hint:  The main competition in the area for this joint is Rum House.  The drinks at Rum House are substantially cheaper and larger.Food is pretty good and it's a very convenient location. However, there is a man who works here who was acting as the makeshift hostess later at night. He had a thin build broad shoulders around 5'9" and African American (saying this description because i want management to know who he is). HE WAS SO RUDE TO US! We had said nothing to him at all. We just walked in like normal patrons. He would not make eye contact with us when we walked in (it was not busy AT ALL) he just didn't feel like getting up. Finally he gets up, still won't look at us, and says "how many?" then he doesn't even walk us to our table. Instead he points from where he's standing, in front of the doorway where we walked in, to which table we should go to. Then he promptly sits back down and resumes looking at his phone with a look on disgust on his face. He didn't even bring us menus, our server did that for us. No one wiped down our table either, it had pieces of food on it. Thankfully i carry wipes with me so i cleaned the table myself. He saw me doing it and still did not lift a finger. This employee clearly just wants to go home and can't be bothered with us which i completely understand HOWEVER you are in the service industry. This is your JOB. Suck it up buttercup. You won't be getting my business again because the standards the owners have for their employees is too low. My server was great though, so 2 stars and not 1. Still, can't imagine how bad it is for those who handled/cooked our food. Don't go here, plenty other places on magazine with amazing service.Sorry wanted to like this place..Underseasoned, over priced and unmotivated staff.Cool atmosphere but overpriced and mediocre flavorless food. It may be working out kinks but that's usually associated with service which was good.It was good!! The environment was nice, the food had a different and very unique taste! & the cook came out to our table and just hung out with us and talked. So great!Everything is very "zesty" which is interesting. The only thing that really bothered me was when we sent back a 4 dollar taco cause it was just weird. Instead of just gracefully taking it back the waitress sent out the manager who asked "is there a problem" as if we are causing a scene or something. Then he proceeded to tell us that most people aren't used to authentic Mexican food. Hmm we were both from California and sort of wanted to laugh in his face. Also, our waitress kept mispronouncing jicama lol Here is a video on how to pronounce it.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KWi4x0LuO1E 
I am hoping Del Fuego is better but I am concerned this new round of " taquerias" are really just tequila bars. Real taquerias  have warm beer and cheap food!Like most others, we went for happy hour.  I almost added an extra "happy hour" star, but I'm not that easy, even after a pitcher or two of some damned good pineapple jalapeño margaritas. Can't beat the drink prices during happy hour.  Everything from the bar is half price, even the $50 tequila fights, shots and of course, the margaritas, along with the tacos, which are ok, but nothing special.  
Cool vibe and the service was spot on.  The appetizers, are so-so.  And we tried several, including chips & salsa (great chips, mediocre salsa) queso fundido, guacamole and cheese dip.  
The best part, four of us got out of there stuffed and buzzed, for $85.Tacos are delicious and authentic. Friendly and fast service. Dinner and drinks is a great deal during happy hour. Fish tacos were my favorite but it was all good.
