The service was great and the food was delicious. It reminded me of my grandmothers food from down south.  The food was perfect not to greasy and not to salty.  Keep up the good work.Just happened to be riding bye and starving . Best stop ever . This seafood chowder is everything . I haven't even touched my meal yet .I guess I'll start with OMG! That catfish was life, it was huge and oh so juicy. The Mac n cheese was good and collars greens. Truth be told I'm an awesome cook and I criticize everything. But I think I may have to apply for a job here so I can get an employee discount when I order everything on the menu!This is my absolute favorite restaurant in Philadelphia! The food reminds me of home with out the issues of commercially created soul food.
The following meal was hands down the best souls food I've tasted here in Philly: Baked turkey wings with greens and Mac and cheese, fried chicken wings and peach cobbler. 
Everything tastes super clean and fresh! The chicken wings are made to order which can explain the wait for some. 
The business is family owned and the food is made with love. I love coming here!Oh my goodness. Oh my goodness. The best macaroni and cheese EVER! This place is in the middle of what seems to be nowhere and a little hard to see from the road, but I'm telling you.. get there. The food is really, really good. I tasted my sister's fried chicken, perfectly seasoned and juicy... I got the Aprons salad because I have a 20 year reunion to get to in two weeks, but it was really good and HUGE for the price. Enough to feed two people. It was so perfectly seasonal with pear, cranberry, goat cheese... I added shrimp. Yum! Everyone thoroughly enjoyed their meals which ranged from the chicken and waffles, turkey wings, fried fish, potato salad, garlic broccoli, and the not to be missed mac and cheese.
Really enjoyed our meal and will return.I just finished eating my braised short rib platter. They serve the ribs without the bone and the meat is plentiful! They were cooked to perfection, seasoned well and very tender. I didn't think to order rice (didn't even think of it as a side) I did, however, order baked mac & cheese and collard greens as part of the platter. They give you a nice sized slice of cornbread with it and it was very good. The mac was good, really cheesy, and the collards were done well also. The greens were a lil sweet tasting for my liking (everyone has different tastes though) but I tossed on some hot sauce and it was good to go!! My mom had a taste (a small taste, I was pretty ravenous) and immediately called up her friends to set a lunch date there. The staff seems friendly and hospitable. I'm not certain who took my phone order but let me apologize now for asking if the macaroni and cheese is "cooked stovetop or baked". Aprons is DEFINITELY real Soul Food!! Thanks y'all!The. Food. Is. Bomb. I was in the mood for a comforting meal, and a friend suggested I look up soul food restaurants. The previous reviews are spot on, and I'd give it 10 stars if I could. I ordered the fried chicken wings, baked mac and cheese, and collard greens. It was AMAZING! I had to slow down as I was eating because I didn't want it to end. My only regret is that I ordered it to go, because when I was done eating I wanted to hug the chef for creating such a wonderful meal. I've definitely found a new favorite food spot in Philly.Best soul food outside of Mississippi... Oh the owner is from Mississippi. The food is true soul food, it's seasoned to perfection, made with love, served with a smile, and comforts you in the first bite. When I'm in philly, I come here every time. It reminds me of home (Mississippi).In town for business, took an Uber there on a Sunday at 2pm. When I arrived they were closed despite having a sign on the door that said "open on sundays 11-5." Very disappointed.Finally tried this place out after driving by for 2 years.  So glad we did, though wish we had done so sooner.  The wife and I did take out, sharing chicken wings and catfish with a range of sides--collards, Mac and cheese, herbed rice and broccoli.  Everything was very tasty.  The wings were big and juicy and the portion of catfish was huge.
The owner was super friendly and we had a nice conversation while we waited.
It will not be another 2 years before we return.Good food. I was a little disappointed that they only fry tilapia & catfish, was hoping to get flounder or whiting. The catfish was good, as was the fried chicken. The sides were delish, they forgot to pack my cornbread though 
Overall, good food, good experience. I will return and remind them to pack my bread! And the wait was about 35 minutes for the two platters I ordered to go.Wow. All I could say for the first five minutes of eating my food here. This place is the real deal. Great food, amazing staff, extremely clean and well kept diner. It's a mom and pop shop that just opened last year with a ton of options for breakfast, lunch and dinner. I ordered the turkey meatloaf dinner with sides of potato salad, collard greens, baked mac and cheese, and corn bread for $12.99. The meal was huge and I ended up splitting it with my friend just fine. Such quality food and authentic taste. I'll definitely be making this a regular go-to for southern comfort food. Give it a try!!The food was very tasty...quick...very clean...the gentleman was knowledgeable and patient with answering my questions...I will definitely return!!!After reading rave reviews about this place, my friend and I came here to try their chicken and waffles. We waited over 45 minutes for our food, and it does NOT take 45 minutes for one waffle with three pieces of chicken wings on it! There were only two other patrons there, so there was absolutely no excuse for this. The chicken wings were under seasoned, and the waffle was nothing to rave about. It was not worth the wait.Went to grab dinner and got a fried chicken wing with sides of mac and cheese and their sweet potatoes. The chicken was made immediately after I ordered it.
The chicken was juicy and crunchy. The mac and cheese was flavorful and not dry. The sweet potatoes were sweet like candy. Overall great soul food even though the price might be slighly elevated.I gave this place two times to get it right. The first time I ordered catfish and grits. The fish was slimy and the grits were soupy. The second time was breakfast again, I ordered french toast, eggs, and bacon. It's was okay. Just okay. Nothing that would make me come back. The French toast was also too sweet for me.So good! The tea is the best and the catfish and wings are yum. Local cheap and delicious! Slow service gives them 4 stars but still very goodSweet Jesus Buddha Mother of the Force is this place freaking amazing!!
The first few times, I couldn't help but get the chicken wings platter - wonderful fried chicken, and oh my god the sides. I've never tasted collard greens like this before. My wife's catfish was crazy good too.
Most recently, we ended up here at lunch time. I had to go back to work so I didn't want to end up in a post-platter food coma, so I conservatively went for the roast pork sandwich...
A word of warning - this isn't the Italian style roast pork with thinly sliced pork and sharp provolone. It tastes more like what would happen if pork was the centerpiece of Thanksgiving instead of turkey. The cubed pork was in this unbelievably delicious gravy.
The chicken cheesesteak is absolutely insane too! I mean, you think a chicken cheesesteak is a chicken cheesesteak, but this one had all kinds of flavors and spices I've never tasted before.
I'm fairly certain that literally every item on their menu is a home run. God bless the family that runs this restaurant.The food was good.......my family decided to dine here after church. I thought the prices was a bit high and the service was mediocre. It was raining that day and there was a leak and bucket blocking the restroom....unsafe.
I thought the staff was extremely disconnected to the customers. I didn't feel welcomed. I ordered the peach cobbler for dessert and it was served to me cold.... what in the world?....who does that? All of the staff appeared to be tired and just didn't care. I love supporting black own businesses....but this is the kind of service I am just not willing to tolerate. I know I won't be returning based on the service. I don't care how good your food taste....good service is ALWAYS good.Food was great, service was OK. Got to this place at 12:30pm and asked for food from the lunch menu, but the worker told me I could only order from the dinner menu (at 12:30pm...).  Bit aggravating since the lunch menu clearly states that the food is available from 11am-3pm, and the worker seemed to be upset with me not ordering from the "right menu".We were in Philly, visiting from Washington, volunteering for the Hillary campaign.  We pulled up yelp to find a place for lunch and decided to give this place a try.  It was EXCELLENT!  Welcoming environment, great menu and delicious food. Between the five of us, we tried a little bit of everything and nothing disappointed.  We were too full to try dessert, but we hear the bread pudding is legendary!   Come, then come again, and bring your friends.Great foooooooooooooooooood. Great service. Great people. Call in advance because food is made fresh. The Red Velvet is to die for.Amazing!
I had no doubt that I wouldn't be impressed by this place.  But man oh man, not only was I impressed by their food, cleanliness, and efficiency/speed...I've been fighting with myself to keep from going back so soon!Listen here, this place is great! The service wasn't A1 when the person knew it was me and my friends first time but the food made up for it ! I will definitely be back!I had the Mac n Cheese, Sweet Potatoes and Greens with a Banana pudding.  Everything was good. Updating I heard the greens were not from the can.  Everything was very good!
I don't know if I will go back Service was great the Lady that helped was really nice.  I would say try it.  I just wasn't eating meat right now.  Probably would have been higher!I had to come out of retirement to write about this gem. I'm always a fan of a business that understands the importance of having great attitudes to compliment great food.  I'll be back!I had the chicken and waffles and it changed my life!! Both were cooked to perfection and seasoned well. I will definitely come here again when i return,I'm so happy this place is in my neighborhood. Great comfort food. Everything here always feel a like a great home cooked meal. The service is also excellent-everyone there is so pleasantHad the fried chicken platter with the included 2 sides, (mac & cheese and the garlic broccoli )which were delicious. I even added an additional side of potato salad and the homemade iced tea. Needless to say I had difficulty breathing afterward but thats MY problem. LOL. Looking forward to trying other dishes and even checking in for breakfast. I'll keep you posted. Patronize this business!Great food. The food is always fresh and warm, and is a good value. I've found myself craving the turkey wings! The tilapia, chicken wings and fried shrimp are also good. Our absolutely favorite item is the sweet potato waffle. As for sides, I typically select the healthier options (broccoli and collard greens). This restaurant is a local gem! One day I'll have to resists inhaling my food and take a photo first!Had a GREAT soul food platter here for takeout. Fried chicken wings were cooked to perfection, Mac and cheese and greens were delicious, and cornbread was on point. This hit the spot and I'll definitely be back.As always, a great time, great energy, and beautiful souls that serve you!! Idk what's better, the staff or the food!! LOL....
And what a surprise we stumbled upon on the 1st Saturday of the month on that snowy day, live music!! Absolutely awesome sounds and vibe!!
Ooooh, the Chicken dumpling is amazing!!!! Never had it before but this was sooo yummy!! A tad bit salty, but tasty!!
Can't wait to revisit... many blessings to Aprons!!!!We ordered from here off of grubhub on a Thursday and everything was great. Decided to come and dine in on Saturday and more of the same in terms of great food. Staff is very friendly, you can see into the kitchen which is kept very clean, and food comes out fairly quickly. I look forward to coming again.This food is awesome! The owners are very good people and they are from Mississippi! My 2nd home!Got chicken and waffles and a homemade iced tea. Food was ok, not great. Waffle was an orange color and heavily spiced. Came with three chicken wings. I paid about $20 for this meal, and I thought that for those prices, I would have liked it to be on a plate instead of a closed take out container on a cafeteria tray.Amazing have gone there 3 times in 2 days. Only about a 10 min wait each time!! I've tried the pork ribs, turkey wings and the French toast and everything was bomb. Worth the money.I must say I was thoroughly suprised. I found this establishment due to Yelp and the reviews.... 
Excellent is a understatement!!!! The custom service was great as well. 
I ordered the braised ribs, mac/cheese, greens and tato salad!!!! It was soooooo good...(you know every one can't make potato salad) LOL 
My sister had the wings, mac/cheese, greens and yams..... Yes i tasted the yams scrumptious!!!!!
I will definitely frequent this spot and I'll spread the word!!!!
Bravo on a "great" eatery... You all should be proud!!!
BlessingsVisited on a Thursday around 4pm. Did not see whiting on the menu and asked the cashier if they served it. Apparently the cashier was also the cook. She was 1 of 2 people that appeared to be working at the time. I  ordered the whiting platter with mac and cheese and rice. The whiting came out as strips devoid of any significant amount of fish meat and tasted burnt. The rice was hard and dry. The mac and cheese was neutral in flavor and temperature.  Even the cornbread was a corner piece that tasted burnt. Will pass on visiting this place againMy boyfriend and I came here once on a Saturday morning and had an amazing experience. The sweet potato waffles were awesome, it was like eating a piece of heaving. Then we came back Sunday morning for brunch and tried the chicken and waffles and feel in LOVE. I cant wait to come back and try the dinner.I was sent a great note from Leon the owner, who confirmed Aprons closing. We look forward to your next chapter in life. We all wish for health and healing for your family. Illness knows no boundaries, we've all been in it or will be in time. -UPDATED 
This place might be amazing, but I was actually writing a review towards claiming the place was permanently closed. I have gone by there several times in the morning and found it locked up tight. Even though the sign says they're open at six in the morning that apparently is not true. Not even at 8:45am. Better go find Tasty Toast.Love this spot! For entree's I have had the meatloaf with brown gravy, and the fried tilapia. For sides, I've had the mac'n'cheese, collard greens, garlic broccoli, and yams; all amazing! Corn bread is great as well.  The staff have always been very polite, courteous and helpful. I live around the corner, and love having such good food and service a short walk away.Used them for catering event. They were amazing, gave great prices and such kind service. Everyone raved about the food. Will definitely use them again and recommend!!!Could not match the HYPE everyone told me about. It didn't have that WOW and can't wait to go back like Ms Toostie's. When you get your soul food grub on at Ms Toostie's it's all about that fried chicken, cornbread and butter with Dat bomb ass ice tea... DAMN!!!!The food is delicious but definitely overpriced (chicken wings with two sides cost $14.95) 
Note: The prices displayed on the menu, online and in the store are inaccurate. The actual prices are approximately $1 more than advertised , not including tax.OK I'm having the turkey bacon with eggs, homefries, wheat toast.      Strawberry lemonade very good.      I will be backGreat food and great people. I enjoyed their food when they were on Cecil B. Moore Ave., and I still enjoy them now. Do yourself a favor and stop by for a try, you'll be back as a regular.Yes, you must try their food.  I had the chicken wings, greens, and yams...Delicious! My hubby had tilapia fish, and garlic broccoli; he loved it.   
However, I didn't like the hairs on the chicken, just my preference, so i removed the skin. Otherwise the chicken was still good. My husband also had the beef ribs, which were smothered in a gravy sauce. He didn't like them at all. We just thought they were bbq....never saw smothered gravy ribs.  
Service was good as well, the restaurant wasn't crowded, we arrived on a Saturday afternoon.Straight up fantastic.
We showed up today, to find a sign "closing early, Saturday, 8/15." I was with my kid and a friend of his (both 9.) We were sad about them being closed, but understand family stuff. So we hunkered down to wait for my wife, who was coming to meet us.
Well, while we were waiting, a woman who must have been the owner came out of the office door. When she saw us, we told her we were sad they were closed. She asked what we would've ordered and I told her I didn't know what I would've gotten, but I was going to get mac and cheese and chicken fritters for the boys. She told us she was sorry - but her daughter and niece were appearing in a fashion show for charity that afternoon, and she was volunteering to help out
Well, she went back inside to close up and get some food for the fashion show, and ten minutes later, she came out with containers of the best mac and cheese I've ever tasted and some warm chicken fingers. 
Unbelievably nice. Completely kind. And totally delicious! The kids ate it UP, and I definitely dug in, too.
I can't wait to go back and order a full meal.My husband was a frequent customer here. So much so, he decided to have their food for my birthday back in September. Everyone really liked the food! I would often even send my hubby for some yams and macaroni and cheese, and banana pudding. Their service was always good when ever we would go. I always heard great things about Leon and his wife. I was sad to see the sign taken down today in passing! I was ready to go home and not have to cook. LOL. I sure wish them all God's blessings and good health and prosperity in their lives. We will keep them in our prayers!Lunch with co-workwers and nobody was disappointed with their order from the turkey meatloaf, catfish, braised beef to the turkey wings. Silence. Thats a good thing because we were too busy stuffing our faces. Personally had the braised beef which was tender and flavorful. The greens were some of the best I ever had. Love veggies so went with the broccoli as well and they made me wish I ordered 2 orders. Potato salad and yams were also sides of choice and the reviews were. So definely a new lunch/dinner locationDelicious soul food. Hits the spot. Found this place by purchasing a deal on Groupon. Nice Mom & Pop business. I had the Mississippi Catfish  (fried) w/ Collard greens & Mac & Cheese. Love it! They even serve breakfast. My boyfriend had Grilled Tilapia w/ Mac & Cheese & candied yams (yams melt in your mouth good). Easy street parking. SO good...I'm already dreaming about coming back.This place is off the chain!! From the entree to the sides, it's packed with flavor in every bite!! If you dine in, there is some smooth music in the background. Definitely worth a visit if you enjoy soul food .I find Philly to be one of the best food cities in the US, and I can still comfortably say that this place has the best fried chicken wings and blackened fish in the City.  I love the chicken at Keven Parker's in Reading Terminal, but Aprons makes the chicken when you order it, so it's crispier and fresher.   I was very surprised when I first tried Aprons's chicken.  The crunch and flavor is really as good as it gets.  The cornbread is delicious too!
This place is clean and the people are really nice.  Since they cook the protein to order, it could take 15-20 minutes for your order to be ready. So, I usually call ahead. 
I urge everyone to eat here so it stays around for a long time because it is delicious.I must say that I was pleasantly surprised.  Whenever I try a new restaurant that claims to serve "soul food" I am usually disappointed.  My main complaint is that the food is too salty, too sweet or it's either over or under cooked. Apron's food was great. We ordered the turkey meat loaf with gravy, baked macaroni and cheese, collard greens and a side of potato salad. Everything was delicious!  What makes it really great is that they are located right in our neighborhood. They were out of peach cobbler and banana pudding by the time we arrived - but I can hardly wait to taste it.  This will definitely be our new spot!!  My husband even gives them 2 thumbs up!!!I haven't found great place for southern comfort food in Philly for a fair price, but Apron's has certainly changed that!
It's a small place on the corner of an intersection that has a lot to offer! Most notably, the fried chicken is on point  perfectly seasoned and crispy on the outside but nice and tender and juicy on the inside (just like how fried chicken is supposed to be). The service is a bit slow, but that's because the food is made to order and is as fresh as can be!
I got MacNCheese and garlic broccoli on the side and both added a lot to the email (in addition to the cornbread). Overall, a great place to quench your southern comfort food cravings! I would definitely recommend to anyone who is on the lookout for such a place.I'm actually sad to be writing this type of review, however it's a must.
I was just informed of this establishment closing from my SistaGirl. My first response was "Oooooh Noooo", and then "Who going make the tato salad"?  (We've ordered the potato salad for a private event). 
On a more serious note, I pray for the health and restoration of the sick!!! This establishment not only put love in their food, but showed it in customer service. I no longer reside near Philly as of last year but whenever visiting I would stop at Aprons. You'll truly truly be missed!! 
Godspeed from this Jersey Girl until we meet again "Prayerfully"!!!The food is amazing! I never ever write reviews (but always read them lol) Anyway, if you are looking for authentic soul food, this is the place. The Mac & Cheese, turkey wings, fried chicken are all delicious. The staff is really nice too. They cook to order, so expect a wait. But it is way worth it!I guess this restaurant is just not for me. I had a bad experience when ordering breakfast so I tried the dinner this time. Seems like nice people own the restaurant but I don't think I'll order again. I got the bbq ribs, mac and cheese, sweet potatoes, potatoe salad, and banana pudding. I loved the sweet potatoes. The mac and cheese had this weird taste to it and it was a bit dry. I wish they made their short ribs bbq because I am not a big fan of pork ribs. The potatoe salad was okay but the potatoes weren't evenly cooked so I didn't eat it. I don't like crunchy potatoes in my potatoe salad. And lastly, the banana pudding was old. That's all I can say because the pudding was brown and sticky as opposed to yellow and creamy.I really like the food. And I frequent the establishment regularly...they have a $10 credit card minimum, which is hard to reach when eating by yourself, and she wouldn't just take my card this time and started arguing about how much it cost to run a credit card...yes, it's the cost of doing business. Do the right thing. Never coming back.UPDATE: Unfortunately, they seem to have closed permanently. I wish them the best; they were cool.

This place is right on the corner of Washington and Grays Ferry, and if you didn't know better, you'd think it was an auto shop (there are several along Washington)
The earlier photos uploaded do not do justice to this place because Aprons now serves their food on proper tableware if you are dining in (older photos show the items in takeaway containers which make it appear less appetizing).
Our kids love the cornbread and the mac and cheese. The fried chicken is well-fried as you'd expect any Southern food to be and is wonderful paired with sweet potato waffles...
The food is really affordable and it's probably as close to the South as you'll get in Philly. It's not exactly the healthiest, but it sure does taste good.Omg! This food was wonderful and the portion sizes are large.  Initially, I thought the food was a little pricey however you can definitely share a plate and still be fully satisfied. Nothing at this place is from a box. Everything is homemade including the banana pudding! It reminded of my grandmother's, prepared and baked...yummy. The staff are really sweet and pleasant. A group of us took an Uber to the restaurant and being from California was not familiar with the area. It's definitely a safe place to eat during the day but I wouldn't recommend walking around at night by yourself. In the end, we would absolutely eat here again!!!Excellent homemade fresh flavorful soul food. First time here and I have to say I am impressed. I had the fried chicken wing platter with broccoli and collard greens with corn bread on the side. The meal totaled $12 but it was worth the money and the portion is large. The restaurant is also very clean and the staff is friendly. The wait is semi long but that is because it is cooked when you order. Well done! Keep up the good work!Bomb.com soul food. Very clean and friendly staff. I had the fried tilapia which comes with two sides. I got Baked mac n cheese and sweet potatoes. If you like your sweet potatoes really sweet like candies you might not like there but I loved them. The mac n cheese was baked well not to dry. Now let's talk about these greens... Boyyy. Collards flavored with turkey . I'm not embarrassed to say I went back get some more to go. The potato salad was also everything I ever needed in life. I think there was dill in it. Not positive but it was yummmmm! Can't wait to kill my left overs. Oh peach cobbler was good too. My step son tore his chicken up so I'm a assume it was good too.We had a wonderful meal at Apron's last week. I had catfish, collard greens and sweet potatoes. The service was quick. We waited less than 20 minutes for our meals. The dining area was clean and welcoming. The good was delicious and cooked perfectly. This place is great for children. One of the best Soul Food restaurants that I have been to :) the prices are very reasonable. This place is highly recommended!!!Southern Style Soul Food. Banging: wings, potato salad, and greens. I had the fried tilapia which was fresh and seasoned perfectly. Prices are great-four platters for $45. Will be back to try peach cobbler.I'll have to admit to being not only a picky eater, but I have to also enjoy the atmosphere! Apron's nailed it for me. My taste buds are never let down & I'm always dressy for seconds... my favorite thing here, hands down, has to be the entire menu. I just tried extremely hard to break down what it was that I loved the most. 
I love that I saw someone in the back skinning sweet potatoes! I'm not sure how they achieved the recipes, but they sure as hell don't do anything canned!CLOSED??!! I believe they are closed. Sad. Best soul food in the city to me. I'll pay for the catfish recipe.   God bless the owner and his family!! #SaluteWe were riding from one section of the city to the other. When we came across this place while waiting for the light to change. Yup sounds like the beginning of a bad Rom-Com.  Anyway we Park n Yelp(sorry I trademarked it already) We walked in and are greeted by smiles and hellos from the staff. Very welcoming and warm. 
The food is your standard Soul Food fare. We ordered Turkey Wings, Mac&Cheese, and Collards. Everything was good but the Turkey Wings were freakin delicious! Tender and seasoned to perfection. We will most definitely be back. The avg price seemed to be around $12.50.  They also had a fried fish sandwich for $6.50. RecommendFood was really good my first time here and me and my family loved everything we had will be back again soonFood was very good! Would definitely eat here again. However, when dinning here don't be in a hurry. friendly service, just slow.  Also be sure to ask what they have available 1st or you will spend your time choosing alternatives.****MY SLOGAN****

I hope you're on your way here too!I live in Germantown and I was a loyal customer to Aprons' Soul food restaurant for years. I just happened to be visiting my sister in South Philly one day and drove past a new spot on Washington Av & Grays Ferry. It was called Aprons . My nephew Steven said that it was a new restaurant that recently opened, I informed him that they were new to the area but not new to my stomach!\
Aprons has delicious Soul food and some pretty good Italian food too. Passing through the doors it all came back to me, you could smell the fried chicken, BBQ ribs and pork chops, the greens and yams with one huge whiff of the kind of aroma therapy that made my amble gut start to quiver.
I saw the owners familiar face and she remembered mine. She said that all of her faithful Germantown customers have found their way here. We exchanged pleasantries but it was time to eat!
I ordered fried chicken and collard greens and candied yams with a side order of potato salad. Everything was fresh and flavorful with that old time soul food experience. I grabbed a peach cobbler for dessert later, and left Aprons a happy man.
And one more tidbit, I haven't experienced the long waits that are sometimes a concern with some soul food spots.So glad we finally have a true soul food spot in the neighborhood! Aprons is a hidden gem on Grays Ferry and the food is delicious. The fried catfish is a must and includes large filets of tender, flavorful catfish that tastes like it just came from the pond.  The fried chicken wings were also large and tender and perfectly seasoned.  The sides were also great - mac & cheese was cheesy and delicious. The only partial let down was that the collards had a ton of stems but it was still delicious. The staff are super nice and even stop by the table to make sure you are enjoying the meal - true southern hospitality!
Enjoy!
