Went here with a few buddies from work for lunch and enjoyed myself. The staff was very friendly toward us and did a great job being attentive. The food came out quickly and my chicken cheesesteak was very good. This place is just as awesome at the one in South Philly, so this maybe a usual lunch spot when at work.This place is simple nothing crazy . You get what you pay for and it's a fair deal. Wouldn't be my date night , perfect for Netflix and chill thou.Not Just Pizza is your standard city pizza shop. I've gotten delivery and takeout from here. Both times the service was quick and the staff were friendly. The pizza is decent. Like other reviewers commented- it's not fancy pizza it's your usual fare, but it's good. The pies are large and it's a bit cheaper than Trio (or seems so at least).Finally -- normal pizza in NoLibs! Yummy, cheesy, greasy (but not too much!), nice crust, convenient. Just what the neighborhood needs. Big fan of NJP and much needed addition to a pizza-lacking neighborhood.The restaurant is filthy. Sticky carpets, grimy floor, boxes and folding chairs shoved in every corner. The kitchen is not properly ventilated so it's sweltering inside. I feel sorry for the staff. I ordered a slice and the woman working the register picked up the sad, dried out slice with her bare hand. When she came back from putting it in the oven she was mopping sweat from her face with the same bare hands she touched my food with. Who knows where her hands had been before I walked in the door. I paid with a five dollar bill, but there was no change in the register so she gave me $3 out of her purse and apologized that the were no coins to give me the rest of my change. The pizza was fine, other than it being all day old evidently. Yes, I ate it. I'm hadn't eaten all day and I was in the middle of a job so I didn't have time to look elsewhere for sustenance. But lesson learned. I won't be back.Stopped in here to get some wings to go for a football game. I got 2 different flavors and both were delicious very flavorful. I also got an order of jalape√±o poppers. They too were very crispy and tasty. I put one in a ziplock bag I think I will eat it tomorrow. I had to take away one star bc my mom kept calling me while I was in the store and it was embarrassing having my phone making so much noise.Have ordered from here many times but the quality the last time I ordered was terrible. Food wasn't the same and it seemed like ownership had changed. They didn't give me any sides the menu said a wrap came with, and wings were burnt. 
I called the manager to return the order. She refused to refund the order and told me that's not how it works. Actually it is. When customers don't aren't happy you apologize and correct the mistake. They won't get my business any more.I ordered the eggplant Parmesan 'easy on the cheese', but they did not read apparently because there was so much cheese on it that I couldn't even see the sandwich underneath. I removed the cheese, ate four bites of a flavorless grease-put of a "sandwich" and once i detected the taste of rancid grease, I gave up and threw it away.Just ordered lunch for the games and was extremely disappointed with our order. I had the breaded chicken cutlet sandwich and the chicken tenders on it were so burnt - it was inedible. Husbands wrap was sloppy and falling apart. I'll pass on ordering from here from now on.After laughing at their TV commercials for over a year, I was curious when NJP opened in NoLibs, and I was very pleasantly surprised.  Their food is great and, unlike a lot of nolibs places, it's great staple take-out food that isn't super expensive..  Their pizza is really great, so are the wraps and the burgers..  The guys that work there are super nice too.. We've been ordering here a ton lately. Great addition to the neighborhoodOrdered delivery. 1/2 plain, 1/2 pepperoni. Whoever the delivery driver was drove like a maniac and the toppings/cheese went everywhere.I absolutely love their food. We get the pizza for work events (cheesesteak pizza is ridiculously good - best around...chicken Parm is not far behind). I tried a few sandwiches today as well and they were all really good too. If I can suggest, do not put plastic over the cheesesteaks. It sticks and pulls off all the cheese!Love this place! Start by saying when you call for a delivery, the guys answering the phone are so nice and polite. Delivery time is always about 20-35 minutes which is awesome, and of course the food is great. I've tried almost every pizza place in the neighborhood & the wings here are effing perfect!! Cooked perfect, taste good and are just flat out awesome. They also have great daily specials. Favorite pizza place in the neighborhood!Wow. This place was great.  Delivery came on time and the delivery guy was pleasant.  I ordered a buffalo chicken cheese steak. There was so much meat and prepared just how i like it on the perfect roll. The cheese fries are skin on potatoes with just the right amount of cheese.  I am very particular about food and this place exceeded my expectation. DeliciousSolid three stars. Prices are fair, and you can grab a restaurant.com gift certificate to pay next to nothing. The homestyle pizza is the standout here... cheese on the bottom, sauce on top. Really tasty. The wings leave a lot to be desired... very small, with bones sticking out of some, undercooked. If you go here, skip them.There are certain things that are my go to but other things that are ok.  I love their salads (strange...I know) and the fries are solid!!Would be 4,stars as this is always my go to spot when I order out. At least once a week. It seems this time they changed their chicken fingers and I am very disappointed. They were great and now they are just gross. Unhappy with that but the rest is still good.I just ordered a Alejandro Pizza from NJP. Let me tell you, this is the best pizza ever. It has spice and sweetness to it. A perfect combo. The Chicken Cheese-steak and BBQ sauce on it is so good. Basically a Home Run Pie. It's getting tougher and tougher to order from here cause there is so many good options to choose from. Some places has one or two things good to order. NJP has it all wings, steaks, turkey club sandwich,steak stromboli and now my new favorite The Alejandro Pizza. Order it and tell me how right i was.I ordered a pizza via the Slice app last night.  Was told it would arrive within an hour.  1.5 hours later - no pizza.  So I called NJP and was told "it will be there in 5 min".  30 min later, still nothing, so I called back and no one answered.  Called Slice to cancel - they tried calling NJP and no one answered.  So Slice called NJP's owner, who said that they store had closed, but the driver was out making deliveries.  I'm not sure why NJP had to lie to Slice and myself about what was happening.  And who closes their store while items are still being delivered?  What if the order was wrong or their was another problem?
I had ordered from NJP a few weeks before via Slice and it was very good.  Then the next day I got a strange phone call from NJP where they accused me of not paying for my food (I paid with a credit card via Slice).  NJP claimed that my order was a call-in, not via Slice.  After I explained how I ordered and even gave them the Slice order number, the NJP person seemed very confused.  She even called back a few minutes later and again demanded that I pay!Don't recommend ordering from here, have gotten food 3 times and all times were bad experiences. First, the place doesn't seem very sanitary. There are kids bikes and toys thrown  around inside the building, and the employees sit in the back of the building smoking and spitting everywhere. Had a friend order a chicken caeser  wrap without the chicken.. and she was told the cook "didn't know how to make it".... ordered chicken tenders with fries and the tenders were frozen in the middle.This is my go to for my buffalo chicken sandwich fix. Not sure about the rest of their food, but the buff chick is great.I have been going to this joint for eight years and just a really solid spot for pizza.  Great service and the owners are always super friendly to talk to and make coming in a nice experience.  I have even had their catering for parties and every time it was really good especially the chicken and peppers, which was amazing.  Their 2 for $30 dinners are great as you get the salad bar, which is excellent and normally $8 on it's own and then you get an appetizer, a very nice main course dish and a dessert so I is a crazy good deal.  Pizza is always good, but per some of the reviews I would suggest ordering it a bit on the crispy side as it can be undercooked once in a while.   Everything is really solid here and would recommend for sure!!Wanted a veggie hero delivered at night. Found them through GrubHub. They got our special order correct and even called to clarify our instructions. Very pleased; will order from them again.Food was below average. Soggy fries. Dry cheese Steak. Asked for well done chicken wings they were anything but well. Just all around disappointing, won't be back.If you live in Northern Liberties Area, this is your place for take out/delivery, cheap, easy pizza. From the few times I have eaten here nothing has been awful - actually, it's been nice having this place in the area.
My usual is a large pineapple pizza with 2 large onion ring orders (my boyfriend and I are bad at sharing) which totals $20.24. The pizza has a very soft crust and it's delicious. They also give you a complimentary garlic butter dipping sauce with your pizza for dipping the crust (or the entire slice). There is a nice thick layer of cheese but it's not disgustingly greasy. The onion rings are fried to perfection - again not too greasy.
I always do pick up at this place and haven't really had a problem except once. We arrived early and our food wasn't ready so we sat down. We waited for another 20 minutes before asking again and actually getting our food....I guess they forgot that we had already arrived?
Overall, this is a solid pizza shop for whenever you are craving pizza (or marathoning Star Wars so you are ready for the newest release).I can only comment on the quality of their cheese pizza. I absolutely love cheese pizza, I've been to countless pizzerias and sampled many cheese pizzas. I've been living in Philly now for four years and THIS is the best cheese pizza I have had since here. Perfect proportion of bread to cheese to sauce, just exquisite. A friend actually ordered it and I didn't know where it was from. After one bite, I said "This is the best pizza I've had in Philly, where is this heaven-sent pie from?", she says "It's Not Just Pizza" and I was like "Ok it is just pizza, but where is it from?" "NOT JUST PIZZA!", she replies, "IT'S THE NAME OF THE PLACE." I say "Ok that's a stupid name but this pizza pie is phenomenal"Having one of those 'I don't want to leave the house and stay in my underwear moments'?  I ordered delivery from Not Just Pizza recently and was pleasantly surprised by the quality and price of their pizza.  I recommend the Homestyle variety.  I like a little extra sauce on my pizza, so for me, this place really hits the spot.  I have ordered delivery from them two times, and each time, the pizza came promptly and warm.  Just remember to put your pants back on when you answer the door.I too was waiting for the normal pizza place that I grew up on for this neighborhood. And well.....I'm still looking.  I gave this place two shots. First with pizza and then a cheesesteak. I ordered a large plain pie for me and some friends and we were all disappointed. The dough was soft and undercooked. The cheese to sauce ratio was not ideal. There was too much cheese and not enough sauce! In the future I will pay a few extra dollars to go to the other pizza place options. 
Now the cheesesteak was just as disappointing. The meat was chopped into oblivion and was dry and flavorless. Then they made the most fundamental mistake in making a cheesesteak. They just put the meat on top of two slices of cold american cheese. It wasn't melted and didn't help keep the dry meat from falling out.Never again will I order from this place (see picture above). The pizza was nearly inedible. The sauce and cheese completely separated (not sure how that's even possible).Figured I grab a slice or a sandwich since its a stones throw from my office...BAD CHOICE on my part...The slice pizza's sitting on teh counter looked horrible...Should have just walked out at this point.   but I ordered a Chicken Parm. Sandwich.. .  Chicken was greasy, refried, chewy and sliced up. There wasn't even 3 oz of chicken on a 12 in roll... Not Just Pizza should do pizza right before they branch out to anything elseI   couldn't agree with one of the other reviewers on this page.  "finally, normal pizza in NoLibs".  I have nothing against other places, but if I want a decent slice of NY style, it's been hard to find.  Overall, I've been kind of disappointed in the pizza here in Philly.  So when I ordered NotJustPizza this past Sunday night I was hopefully, but knew not to get too excited. 
    Well, finally, a good pizza place around here!  And they serve garlic dipping sauce with their pizza's, which to me, was like finding a pearl in an oyster around these parts!  The pizza was good, I go with standard pepperoni so I have a level playing field when comparing to others.  I also got wings, Garlic Buffalo style.  Excellent.  I'd reccommend to anyone.  
   it's just good ole fashioned pizza and wings, the way pizza and wings should be made.  And best of all, they don't charge these ridiculous "we are hipster" prices.  I got a small pizza with pepperoni, order of delicious wings, delivery (which was fast), all for about $15.  Can't beat that to feed two people without having to leave my living room!I recently placed a order to Not Just Pizza. I ordered a chicken cheese steak with fried onions,  and a Turkey Club. I was very impressed with my steak. It had flavor and toasted the way i wanted it. Best cheese steak i had in awhile from a pizzeria. Definitely recommend it!!  My girlfriend got the turkey club and it was amazing. It had bacon and all the fixings. I tried a bite of it and it taste so good. The turkey wasn't lunch meat turkey. i don't like that wet stuff. This was real Turkey Breast. The turkey flavor was on point. I will be ordering that for myself next time. This is now my favorite spot to order from. Finally a pizza store i can call and know my food is gonna be good. Definitely 4.5 stars worthy.This is my first time writing a yelp review. I'm doing you a favor by telling you to NOT order from this shit hole. It is absolutely disgusting. First of all, the delivery took an hour. I ordered a pizza that tasted as if they melted Kraft single slices of cheese on top, buffalo garlic wings that came as sauced up breaded chicken pattys, sans garlic, and a turkey wrap that I took one bite of and put down. I'm not sure it's really turkey, but I am almost positive that I will probably have the shits after just tasting all this crap. The best thing about this meal is probably the chips that came with the wrap. Papa John's is like a 4 star pizza joint compared to this god awful place. I want my money back. And my colin. Wtf, I'm FORCED to leave a star? They should get morsel of glitter.great NY style pizza at a good price. I had pepperoni and mushrooms this time. Pizzas come with garlic sauce, like Papa Johns, and are a welcomed extra touch.  Ironically others on the menu at this location aren't very good, i.e. cheesesteaks and anything deep fried, so it's pretty much just a pizza place for me
Pizza by the slice and not as obnoxious as Rustica on 2ndim a god damn pizza snob, being from north jersey. but YO. NOT JUST PIZZA IS GOOD! plain or pepperoni slices to the face all day, everyday please!This place has great wings. I just don't understand how you deliver someone 50 messy bbq wings, yet not put one napkin in the bag. This has happened numerous times also with smaller orders. S
o this isnt a one time thing, but enough for me to post. Only reason for the 5 stars are the wings are great. But that napkin thing is annoyingThis place has great wings! They're always accurate and on time with deliveries as well. The food is great especially for the variety they offer. I recommend this place!Amazing pizza, always. Love that they give you garlic sauce too! 
Mozz sticks are also a good choice.First time delivery of wings: 10 Old Bay, 10 hot, both orders extra crispy. Both were tasty, and hot.  And, the delivery was speedy. My only regret is that I asked that the "hot" be as hot as they could make them and that wasn't very hot at all.So this is a culmination of ordering from Not Just Pizza. I'll start with the cheese pizza order. Not just pizza delivers a very good pie. It's most similar to papa johns pizza if you want a comparison to a large pizza chain. That being said, the crust is great, the sauce is delicious and the cheese is flavorful and plentiful. (Oh not to mention, all of their pizzas come with a cup of (while not home made, specialty garlic sauce) So if you love garlic and butter I'd suggest that you try out Not Just Pizza. Their homestyle pizza is excellent. It comes with a thick layer of cheese on the bottom with marinara on top. I've also ordered their cheesesteak and buffalo tenders, which compared to their pizza were pretty average, but still very good. I also ordered their buffalo chicken pizza which was a white pie with buffalo chicken and it also came with garlic sauce. As other reviewers have mentioned their buffalo items aren't very spicy. So if you have a good tolerance for heat you may need to add some hot sauce at home to get their buffalo items at the right spice level for you. If you have a low tolerance for spiciness then fear not of their buffalo tenders nor their buffalo pizza you will enjoy it. That being said, Not Just Pizza is a bit more expensive than some of the other local pizza joints north of center city. As you can see from my recap below. Overall, I've only ordered not just pizza from Not Just Pizza once.... and it was average compared to their pizza. So my suggestion is that they change the name to "Just Pizza.....and some other things" Haha just kidding. Solid pizza joint and one of the best non-high-end pizza places I've encountered. A solid 4 stars.

The buffalo chicken hoagie was different then the description and was not breaded like it said. Andddd they have the driver my wrong number even though it was right on my yelp! All they refunded was $3.50 for this inconvenience!! You just lost a loyal customer!!!!The food is absolutely amazing. Their homestyle pizza is to die for. And the customer service is great as well. I eat there every week. Def my go to spot. And that won't change. Keep doing what your doing guys cause it is working for me!Yep, their name doesn't lie. I ordered from Not Just Pizza during my quest for a hot dog delivery on National Hot Dog Day. A quick search of GrubHub showed that my options for such a delivery were limited, but NJP saved the day (and assisted with my exceptional laziness) with a pretty good Texas Tommy. Woo!
Since I wasn't just going to order a single hot dog for delivery, I also decided to try their pizza and a Caesar salad. The salad was okay. Super basic, but not bad. The five-cheese white pizza was also standard. I'd consider ordering from this place in the future, but they're not at the top of my preference list. Average, but again, not bad.Have you ever seen those annoying Not Just Pizza commercials? "NJP ... yea you know me ..." Despite all the warning signs, I figured I would finally give them a shot. So I hopped on Seamless to finally check them out (though the receipt says GrubHub).
Half White / Half Home-Style [$10.99]
16'' large pizza
Naturally, the GF and I had to try their pizza. Not sure if we wanted a whole white slice, NJP was able to split it - half white and half "home-style," which is always appreciated.
White Pizza
Provolone, mozzarella cheese, white garlic sauce
The pizza was a bit more doughy than I usually like and could have used more seasoning. And while there was plenty of cheese on the white slice, it wasn't especially garlicky, which is what I usually associate with white slices.
Home-Style Pizza
Homemade sauce, sliced mozzarella, Parmesan
The home-style is essentially a red slice. The sweet marinara was on top of a very thin, almost non-existent layer of mozzarella. Oregano came through nicely, but could have used more hits of the Parmesan to add some seasoning.
Chicken Italiano Sandwich [$7.95]
Breaded chicken, broccoli rabe, roasted pepper, provolone
The GF wasn't really in the mood for pizza, so we also got the chicken italiano sub. The rabe was nicely garlicky with a bit of heat on the tip of the tongue. The chicken could have been seasoned a bit more though. For someone who hates salty food, I couldn't get over the lack of it here.
Wing Dings [$6.99]
I saw wing dings on the menu and thinking of the crispy ones at Pandora's, I couldn't help but get an order of those as well. The buffalo garlic wing dings were nicely seasoned and the accompanying blue cheese was an obvious, but great counterbalance. While they weren't as crispy as Pandora's, these were definitely fall off the bone.
Cheese Fries [$3.50]
We also got an order of cheese fries, which had decent crunch and nice seasoning as well. The whiz came on the side which is always a nice touch for delivery.
Overall, Not Just Pizza or 'NJP' wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. However, it certainly wasn't the best I've had. Even the pizza wasn't my thing - it's amazing what a bit of seasoning will do. But who knows, maybe the second time is the charm? 
Bumped up to three stars just for the wing dings.Place has become my favorite spot since moving to the area. Pizza is very good and the chicken cheesesteaks are awesome. Never let down and have ordered from here many times.I had just a plain cheese slice, but that is the best judge of a pizza jawn anyway. I was there early, 11:30am so the slice was pretty fresh. It was like good boardwalk pizza - gooey, cheesy, very saucy & not dried out. AND, drum roll....it was $1.69!! That makes it even better. I wish I lived closer, but it is on my 'to do' list for no. libs.Ordered a slice and mozzarella sticks. Place was super hot inside, so waited outside and sat on a ledge. Luke brought the food to us, awesome customer service. Awesome food.Have lived in the neighborhood for a few years now and always enjoyed NJP. Something has changed!  The place was never the most pleasing aesthetically, but the food was always good. Must have changed owners, completely empty inside and looks like 3 people off the street behind the counter. We ordered a plain cheese pizza and I watched as the lady behind counter had to ask for a large dough to be handed to her by some guy who just came in from the back door. No hands washed. She tossed the dough back and forth between her forearms and at point dropped it, luckily onto the counter. She took a look see if anyone saw her and then casually picked it up and started tossing it between her forearms.  Stay away. This place looks like a dead man walking.The pizza here is just okay. I like that they actually use fresh mushrooms but don't care for how thick and non crisp the crust is. After requesting the pizza be made "well done" it was still pretty soft. It is not awful but definitely wouldn't be my first choice.Decent pizza wings and cheesesteaks ! Very standard, nothing fancy but my reliable hangover go-to! I always ask for the wings to be well done.Food is ok but the lady with face tattoos was very rude didn't say hello was angered by any questions and didn't answer any of my questions with a legitimate answer. If you want a business to survive don't hire unprofessional morons to work the register and deal with clients.Ordered a turkey hoagie and the bread was old and stiff. They were extremely stingy with the meat and cheese and the thing look more emaciated than an African child. I guess I can't be too upset with the quality of the ingredients, who would want even more of something bad?
The girlfriend got a tuna wrap and it was extremely soggy and wet. The tuna was also of low quality, the kind that is Brown and wet and smells extra fishy. The white flour tortilla was gummy so she transplanted the guts of the wrap into a new tortilla from our fridge. After one bite she threw the whole thing in the trash.
I don't usually write reviews but this place is so bad i figure i should get some justice by spreading the word. It wouldn't be worth the walk back to try and return the wrap for a refund. Dealing with the behemoth woman behind the counter again would be even worse than being waterboarded. Oh Yeah, I didn't mention the atmosphere walking into the place was more awful than a funeral. What a nightmare of a Friday night.  The name of this establishment is like a cruel joke.Food is good, but be wary of online ordering-- due to communication issues between the restaurant and its third party ordering service, our Super Bowl Order was lost in the shuffle.I've been going here at least once a week for the past couple months only because it's walking distance from my home. It's a pretty solid pizza joint. The pizza is cheap and really good, burger is greasy (drunk me loves it), and their buffalo chicken tenders are filling. They have good lunch coupons and the staff is pretty friendly. If this place is walking distance from anyone, I highly suggest trying it out.Like this place a lot!  My husband and I used to have a go-to order of the homestyle pizza and wings.  Their wings are the best I've found that are local to us, great sauce (and lots of it).  Sadly they don't deliver to our new place.I fell in love with their food!!! Specialty pizza is the best so does everything else. You gotta try this place yummy yummy!!!ehhhh......nothing great....ordered hoagie with extra oil and got hoagie with no oil.  Roll was not fresh, wings were kinda boney.  Will stick with Del Rossi'sWe love right around the corner from this place, but ordered a pizza for delivery because we were watching college football. Lazy? Yes. But we paid the fee and tipped generously for 1 cheese pizza. It took 1 hour and arrived to us cold. Like I said we live less than 2 blocks away. The cheese was so cold it had hardened. I won't be giving this place my business again.NJP is lucky to be getting one star from me. If it gives you any indication how disappointed I am, I've never taken the time to review a restaurant on yelp. Major contributor...I had a small piece of metal in my cheesesteak...yes, metal?! Unacceptable! Pizza nothing special either. Maybe they should be 'Just Pizza' and try doing one thing rightOrder took 1:30 to arrive.  If you are willing to wait a long time, go ahead.If my $17, colder-than-room-temperature 12" would've arrived at my door in say... an hour? An hour and fifteen even?... I would've chalked this whole experience up to a mediocre pizza place, and talked myself into ordering from here again. Unfortunately, it took an hour and forty mins and a rude phone conversation with your staff to end up putting your cold pizza in my own oven. 
Never. Again.I ordered my meal last night via grubhub- 10 sweet and spicy wings and a bacon cheeseburger. The food arrived an hour later. The burger was covered in buttery grease and was burned. The wings were initially delicious, however, I woke up with a start at 4am to discover I had food poisoning. I would not recommend this place to my worst enemy. I wouldn't recommend this place to voldemort to distract him from gathering the deathly hallows. It was a terrible experience.Not just pizza is what everyone else has described. Their normal, down to earth and fairly priced shop won me over initially, but the staff is what has made me a repeat customer.
One of the first times I ordered from here, the cheese fell off of the pizza. I called just to let them know and, not anticipating anything in return, was offered a free pizza anytime. When I ordered again, the manager came to shake my hand and apologize for last time. They definitely went above and beyond.
This last time that I ordered, apparently the delivery guy slipped on our step ans the cheese slid off(to be fair I think it may be the American cheese) and after calling to let them know, they apologized profusely and sent out another identical pizza with a free 2 liter! These guys seem to really care about their customer base.
Some companies still know how business is done.
I signed up for a yelp account just to make this. I think that says something.Pizza= eh. Needs more sauce. Like the soft crust but was kind of cold by the time it got to me. 
This review is about the delivery. WORST DELIVERY SERVICE I HAVE EVERY HAD. I get it, I live in the city, parking it sparse. But to be honest that isn't my issue. Do not call me and tell me to come meet you down on the street to pick up my order. Not only did my delivery person tell me to do that, I could barely understand a word he said because all he would repeat is "no parking, no parking" in a heavy Italian accent. Bro, I know there isn't parking, I just told you there's a valet zone you can put your flashers on right outside my building bring my pizza upstairs to my apartment and earn your 20% tip (AND DELIVERY FEE!!!) so I don't have to put a bra on and make myself look presentable. He hung up on me and ended up leaving my pizza at the front desk. So so rude. Will never be ordering from here again. BYE FELICIA!!Some co-workers ordered from here recently and asked if I would like to get something. One guy was getting the Italian Supreme hoagie (Italian hoagie with sharp provolone and roasted peppers) and it sounded good to me. 
It was a good choice. The Italian meats and cheese were fresh and the roll was good. They don't mention what brand roll but I am guessing it was a Sarcone? They charge .60 cents more for a seeded roll though. I understand that type of roll is popular but to charge more for it? I guess I appreciate the fact that they give us a choice.
Delivery was prompt and friendly. I don't remember how long it took exactly but it was sometime between a half hour and an hour.
The menu covers everything, sandwiches, salads, side orders, and pizza. Have not tried the pizza yet but I can give the hoagie my recommendation as I have had the Italian Supreme twice now and it was consistently good both times.
This could very well be one of our regular picks for lunch.Im not gonna lie, the food was better is just okay now. The owner is great (Sal) but the other staff is sometime a little on the rough side on how they speak inside. Delivery is hit or miss  with times. Im a block away and it could be a 20minutes or 70. I never can figure the rhythmI live around the corner from this place. Service was terrible, I ordered buffalo wings , first of all the wings had a weird smell. ( I thought maybe it was the buffalo sauce). When I bit into the wings the bones had this  bloody slime .I am not going back.Chose this as my first review because I'm quite happy to finally have a place with decent hoagies and pizza/wings in the neighborhood.  So far I've had their plain pizza, buffalo wings, and tuna hoagie.  
As others have mentioned, the pizza is a no frills decent NY style pizza and is IMO better than any of the other offerings nearby.  The wings (ordered hot w/ blue cheese) were also quite decent and I'm definitely going to get them again.  I've also ordered their tuna hoagie on 3 different occasions now and it's exactly how I like it!  The perfect amount of mayo, not slim or overstuffed, and VERY tasty.  The bread could be a bit crunchier, but otherwise it's awesome!Disgusting. My sandwich looked like it was picked out of the trash. Also they don't care if you think it tastes gross. It's "how they make it everyday." So I didn't even eat what I paid for, and they refuse a refund. Bummer. With so many great and friendly pizza places around stay clear of this one.Pizza & wings are yummy.  Kids loved the chicken fingers.  I would give 5 stars if the service was good.I will be the first to say, I'm addicted to panzorattis and this place does it right. Hell, this place is to blame for my addiction! I lived not even two blocks from this place for a few months and between the sweet cheese pie deal they offer and the panzorattis (okay and calzones) - I never went hungry. Whatever sauce they conjur up- I believe they put something in it. I don't know how else I can describe this love, I haven't found a shop that mimicks the deep fried ridiculousness and I will accept any competitors with open arms. 
Not just pizza, you need to franchise and follow me wherever I go. I understand if you don't, i'd bike down to 11th and wolf when need be.I got the Greek pizza and tomato pie well dine as usual and it was great as usualI've gotten good from here a few times now and have never had an issue. I just placed an order that included a two liter of soda and a slice of cheese pizza. We opened the order and they forgot to give us the soda, and my freezing cold slice of pizza had some sort of meat on it and the cheese was picked off with an unmelted chunk on top. We called to have them redeliver our soda and a of cheese, not meat pizza.
They were very rude when we called and They informed us on the phone that they were out of cheese pizza so they 'picked the meat off.' I'm pretty sure they tried to cover it up by adding a slice of cheese on top of that.
When I asked for a $2 refund since they gave me the wrong pizza they basically said no. So gross that they were picking meat off my pizza .. for all they know I could be allergic. They should have called when the order came through to let me know that they only had meat pizza left. 
Then the poor delivery guy who's first day it was gave us money out of his own pocket for the pizza (which we tried to give back to him). He should be working inside making pizza and the idiots who think it's okay to pick apart someone's pizza should be fired. Never ordering from here again.I ordered through grubhub, which gives you a time frame for delivery. 20 minutes after the allotted time I had to call grubhub to see where my order was. It took another 20 minutes after that for me to actually receive my food. The restaurants excuse was that they "had other orders to delivery" but if you are going to give a time for delivery, be there in that time. Absolutely awful. The man who delivered my food was a foul troll as well. Beyond that, my food was soggy and gross. NEVER again.Yesterday I ordered two pies, a plain and a pineapple. We waited an hour and a half to get our food. We called and they said it was coming. Once our food was here, it was slightly warm. At this point my guests and myself were so hungry, we didn't care. The pizza was okay. Overall, it was a bad experience. I don't think we will go back.I ONLY order from Not Just Pizza, they have practically any sandwich, salad, or pizza you can ask for they also have Ice Cream. Sal the Boss is the most friendly and accommodating as a food business boss can get. The girls answering the phone need some etequite schooling, but good help is hard to find. I would have given it 4 stars but Sal brings it over the top with his friendliness and service.Not great. 
I ordered wings w/ extra sauce on the side, sweet potato fries, and a diet coke. The diet coke was the best part. 
The delivery was fast (about 25 minutes). 
The wings tasted fresh and were a good size. However, they barely had any sauce on them and I never got extra sauce on the side as I asked. The veggies that came with the wings looked and tasted old. The blue cheese, which was pre-packaged, tasted spoiled. Honestly, the blue cheese ruined the entire meal. 
The sweet potato fries were undercooked. More like sweet potato mash. Very soggy, barely warm and unenjoyable. I ended up just throwing them out. 
I won't be ordering from them again.Ok so I've been lazy and haven't updated reviews lately. So this is a culmination of ordering from Not Just Pizza. I'll start with the cheese pizza order. Not just pizza delivers a very good pie. It's most similar to papa johns pizza if you want a comparison to a large pizza chain. That being said, the crust is great, the sauce is delicious and the cheese is flavorful and plentiful. (Oh not to mention, all of their pizzas come with a cup of (while not home made, specialty garlic sauce) So if you love garlic and butter I'd suggest that you try out Not Just Pizza. Their homestyle pizza is excellent. It comes with a thick layer of cheese on the bottom with marinara on top. I've also ordered their cheesesteak and buffalo tenders, which compared to their pizza were pretty average, but still very good. I also ordered their buffalo chicken pizza which was a white pie with buffalo chicken and it also came with garlic sauce. As other reviewers have mentioned their buffalo items aren't very spicy. So if you have a good tolerance for heat you may need to add some hot sauce at home to get their buffalo items at the right spice level for you. If you have a low tolerance for spiciness then fear not of their buffalo tenders nor their buffalo pizza you will enjoy it. That being said, Not Just Pizza is a bit more expensive than some of the other local pizza joints north of center city. As you can see from my recap below. Overall, I've only ordered not just pizza from Not Just Pizza once.... and it was average compared to their pizza. So my suggestion is that they change the name to "Just Pizza.....and some other things" Haha just kidding. Solid pizza joint and one of the best non-high-end pizza places I've encountered. A solid 4 stars.

I've ordered a chicken cheesesteak and the bread was terrible! I ordered atomic wings and there was an explosion of blandness! I ordered pizza, and it was doughy with rotten vegetables and skimpy sauce! Not Just Pizza, what happened to you????!!!So ordered through grub hub wings and a panzarotti, asked for "crispy or well done" wings not wanting gross soggy wings. When ordering although it says it comes with blue cheese and carrots and celery, you actually have to pay for "extra" and they send you one (i.e.: I paid a dollar for one ramekin of blue cheese) and got no celery or blue cheese. You are also required to pick one of those "extras" to complete your order. My food arrived quickly and the driver handed me a very wet paper bag, all the hot sauce had leaked out when I went to ask why he literally ran back to the car. When I opened the bag I saw the wings (definitely not well done, just very hot) had melted through the container. So I call grub hub and they call not just. Not just says I can return to them every wing for a refund, I ask if the driver is coming back cuz, yes I will, and they hang up on grub hub. So you bring me inedible food (no not eating food that's sitting in melted styrofoam), you upcharge for items that are said to be included, and you hang up on people when they need a correction. Thanks, guess we're done. I'll order from Oogies or little Sicily from now on. Photos included for good measure. Thanks for making my kitchen look like a hot wing murder scene.Best pizza in the city. Their breaded chicken parm pizza is exemplary. 
Always very nice tooReally, really, REALLY good stuff. This was my first time ordering, over a week ago.
Their Italian Hoagie is great. All the right meats were in this terrific sandwich, right down to the prosciutto! I only had half and placed the other half in the fridge to eat the next day. Much to my surprise, it was not soggy or gross the next day. Tasted just as good as it did at the time of purchase. 
The small white pie with anchovies was enjoyable as well, but I wasn't sure if there was any garlic on the pizza. I wondered if the garlic dipping sauce was there for that reason. I was craving a white pizza and I went for it. Their 12 inch is VERY reasonably priced. Other places wanted 1-2 bucks more for a 10 inch! 
From these 2 items, I had 3 meals over 2 days. I was pleased. With tax & delivery it came to $16'ish. $20 with tip. Not bad! Not bad at all. I would definitely order from these guys again. And it's nice when the person answering the phone is outgoing and friendly. Whomever the guy was who I spoke to, he was really nice! Even asked if I needed milk, eggs or any groceries -- even dessert. Now that's tempting! LOLI called at 10:49 for a pick up order and the girl who answered the phone stated that they were closed. when I said that it wasn't 11 she said "we start counting the drawer at 10:45".  Don't post a closing time of 11 if you're not going to serve anyone after 10:45. all I wanted was a cheesesteak platter but I'll make sure to take my business elsewhere from now on.How can I explain how bad this place sucks? First of all, I ordered a pancake platter and the guy who took my ordered wasn't fluent in English. He screwed my order up after I repeated 3 times pancakes, eggs and bacon. But I got burned bacon that tasted more like pork grinds, no eggs and giant greasy pancakes !!! 
I'm waiting for them to remake my order correctly as I write this review. The biggest Con is lack of service and the fact these employees do not listen. I had to repeat 4 times what I wanted. Although they agreed Id get a 13 dollar credit towards food when I called about the incorrect order, this place sucks so bad I do not want to come back here and order anything else they'd mess that up too. I'm so mad, but this is why I call this place Not Just Grease because the service is Not so "good."I called to place an order around 9:45AM for pickup at 10:45AM. I ordered a cheese pizza, pepperoni pizza, and egg salad sandwich. Their prices were slightly cheaper over the phone than what was posted online. I arrived at the restaurant around 10:50AM to pickup my order. When I walked in, the girl behind the counter didn't acknowledge my presence for over 5 minutes. She just continued to be really frustrated with entering things into the register and conferring with another coworker. If it wasn't for the customer behind me acknowledging my presence, I would have thought I was invisible. As the employee ignored me, she took two buns out of the roll display. She did this without washing her hands and with her bare hands after she was touching the register and a bunch of other things. During this time, a male employee came to help her out and greeted me. Finally, around 11AM, she decided to ask me what I needed. It was slow and a hassle to get my order. Everyone there seemed like they didn't know what they were doing. The only reason they got two stars was because the food wasn't too bad, but it definitely wasn't good enough to convince me to return.Tossed the menu in the trash  to this place. Ordered food with simple instruction of sides and they disregarded everything after I reiterated it four times on the phone...I'm an easy going person so it takes a lot for me to lose patience. Ordered my girlfriend a grilled chicken sandwhich and they must've had a scarcity of chicken because she got about 1/4 of a chicken breast...plenty of other places that'll handle your hunger- look beyond this one.Just ordered from there asked for chicken wings well done they weren't even cooked and hands down worst pizza I've ever ate :( never againThe food is not bad, but we ordered multiple orders of fries and they failed to include one of them in the order. When we called about it they said they never got the order and did not bill us for it, but the itemized bill matched with what we paid when we got there to pick it up. This is not the first time that they've screwed up an order and denied any responsibility.Not feeling like cooking or walking somewhere, my roommate and I ordered dinner from here recently.  The estimated delivery time given to us by grubhub was about an hour and the driver was right on time so no issues there.  
I ordered buffalo chicken fingers and fries (healthy, I know...).  When I opened the container with the chicken, I wasn't sure if they were covered in buffalo or barbecue sauce because the sauce they used looked darker in color than I was expecting but then the spicy smell hit my nose and I knew it was buffalo.  It looked to be a very promising meal until I took my first bite.  The chicken fingers were so spicy that I could only eat two of the pieces before tossing the rest.  I love super spicy food, and their sauce had a nice flavor and I liked that it was homemade instead of just texas pete, but there was way way way too much heat to it and it made it unenjoyable.  The fries were good though and they looked like they were hand-cut so that was a plus.
It seemed like they were a step-up in the ingredients they use over typical pizza places, so we'll probably order from here again, I just know to avoid anything with the word "buffalo" in the title.This place needs to be renamed to "Not EVEN Pizza"! 
We have never, ever, had the worst, strangest, most awful pizza than from this place.  Phone girls are rude and sound like a bunch of kids.  Delivery always takes way  too long (like over an hour) and it arrives barely warm.  When you call to complain after 45 minutes to an hour, all they say is that the driver is out and on the way after saying, when you place the order, that it will be there within the hour.
Also, the wings are totally disgusting.  Old, dry, fried in fryer grease that is as old as Moses.  Inedible.Mere steps from where I live, this place is going to become a take-out mainstay in our household. Today we tried the turkey club wrap, wings, poppers, and funnel cake fries.
Funnel cake fries. I had a hard time picturing these, but they ended up being fry-shaped sticks of funnel cake batter, lightly sweet, crisp on the outside, and embarrassingly yummy in a greasy sweet dough kind of way.
Their wings deserve props for probably the best buffalo wings I've had in Philly. They're actually hot! It's not just the standard Frank's red hot wing sauce, they are using something different here and it has a kick. The wings are also large and super meaty. I was quite pleased. The poppers were also good - cream cheese instead of cheddar, which is the way I like them.
Bonus points for having various ice cream treats available, including shakes. That will be awesome this summer!The employees DO NOT WEAR GLOVES while preparing food. The blonde girl behind the register touched our pizzas after touching the phone, credit cards, her drink and cash register. The employee making the hoagies did not have any gloves either. When questioned as to why hoagies and pizza were handled without gloves, the blonde girl behind the counter who said she was the manager immediately had a nasty attitude and said "oh you wanna refund?" She then proceeded to threaten to have us beat up by her brother who she would call. As a nurse I am appalled that food is prepared this way considering that you can die from food poisoning as well as the shocking behavior of the employees. I have reported this to the health inspector as well and when I told her i would be, she said "Go ahead!"This place has great wings, just how I like them. But, I ordered for delivery and what I got was ALL over inside the bag, sauce everywhere. I called and after speaking to the owner and paying for extra sauce and tipping extra they did nothing about it, but blamed the driver! I took Not Just Wings off of my speed dial! STEAK-EM UPon speed dial. Would have given them a fivebut they didn't give good customer service, just say'n.I eat here all of the time. Granted, it's around the corner from my house. But I love the selection in their menu. They serve everything! Their pizza is just ok. Their burgers are great, but don't forget to tell them your toppings or else you'll get only the burger. The fries are good, too. The best thing I've ever gotten was the taco wrap with American cheese and the panzarottis. Yum! The taco wrap was just like a burrito, and the buffalo chicken panzarotti was so amazing. It was slightly sweet from the dough which was a pleasant surprise. This place is cheap and fast so it's great anytime. They also have a small selection of basic groceries, so it's def a good place when you want dinner and also need milk and eggs for the morning.Terrible customer service. Grubhub order took over two hours to come .5 miles. Will not be ordering again and would not recommend to anyone. Order at your own risk.I ordered a pizza via the Slice app last night.  Was told it would arrive within an hour.  1.5 hours later - no pizza.  So I called NJP and was told "it will be there in 5 min".  30 min later, still nothing, so I called back and no one answered.  Called Slice to cancel - they tried calling NJP and no one answered.  So Slice called NJP's owner, who said that they store had closed, but the driver was out making deliveries.  I'm not sure why NJP had to lie to Slice and myself about what was happening.  And who closes their store while items are still being delivered?  What if the order was wrong or their was another problem?
I had ordered from NJP a few weeks before via Slice and it was very good.  Then the next day I got a strange phone call from NJP where they accused me of not paying for my food (I paid with a credit card via Slice).  NJP claimed that my order was a call-in, not via Slice.  After I explained how I ordered and even gave them the Slice order number, the NJP person seemed very confused.  She even called back a few minutes later and again demanded that I pay!Service there is poor. You walk in and everyone is yelling. The food is ok, not very good. Simple orders take a long time. And there is a $15 minimum for credit purchases which is lame. Save yourself some money and go somewhere else. Big Dans and Mazzas are right there and are way better than NJP.Have you seen the TV commercials for these guys? They're incredible & I'm surprised they haven't gone viral by now: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JrPhNWwOho
Came here on a hot day in the summer with my two friends. I'm not FROM Philly, but I've lived here for the past 4 years so I consider myself a local. The second we walked in the door, they implied "you aren't from around here are you guys?" Well no, I guess my pronunciation of "wooder" wasn't enough to impress them.
The place is a combo pizza shop, convenience store and I totally love the vibe. We chatted back and forth with the staff as we made our pizza selections. There wasn't any seating so we sat on the curb outside which made the experience all that more enjoyable.
Awesome pizza, awesome people. Check it out.The stromboli is not bad. But we waited almost an hour and half for food. It was cold. The side of sauce was literally from the fridge and put into a container. The burger bun was hard. I assume from being toasted and the cooled down. Sweet potato fries were burnt and cold. 
When I called and asked where our food was she instantly said its on its way and should be there soon. I didn't give her any info. It was a generic response. Then I asked her when he left and where was he in the deliveries. She said she just came in and the order was from the day shift and has no idea about anything with our delivery. So she lied which I already knew and had a really nasty attitude. Will not be ordering from here again. Bad customer service was just the icing on the cake.Not Just Pizza but oh how good is the pizza. This is my favorite place to get pizza in the city.  One day I'll try another dish.I just ordered a breakfast platter, and after an hour of waiting I open up a container full of burnt waffles that were hard as rocks. Never ordering from this place again. I couldnt even cut through them so I had to just pick them up with my hands and take bites. Yuck...a shame because their location in Sicklerville is great!Great steaksNJP is right around the corner from my house, and I'm glad about that. They are friendly, quick, and inexpensive. We probably order from there every couple of weeks. 
Get the Home Style pizza- friends of mine drive across the city for it! It comes with the cheese underneath the sauce and it is completely delicious. 
The NJP salad is good. For other appetizers, they have the usual stuff: mozz sticks, jalapeno poppers, etc and they do it just about as well as anybody else. Hits the spot!
As for sandwiches, their mixed cheese hoagie is like any other; their veggie hoagie (which comes with fried eggplant and a bunch of other things) is a bit inconsistent- sometimes too greasy, sometimes not enough cheese, sometimes just right. It's worth the risk though! Add BBQ sauce for an extra punch.
They also have a wide selection of ice cream novelties i.e. Choco Tacos and Good Humor bars, plus some grocery items. Their selection of grocery items is somewhat random, so don't count on getting what you need there, especially if what you need is dry cat food.Down 2 stars because delivery took almost an hour and a half. It was a Wednesday  night! 
Pizzas we ordered were way overcooked and burnt on the bottom. The delivery guy was sort of cocky. Delivered all but the pizza and when the roomie stated we ordered 2 small pizzas he got cocky and said,"Yeah, well I had to park all the way up the street." Um, yeah.. and? Isn't that your job? 
The only thing that saved this experience was the Chicken Supra sandwich.A friend had a gift certificate for this place which was about to expire so we stopped in on a Sunday afternoon when no sports team was playing. The place was busy with the phone ringing several times as we waited for our calzones. Wait time was typical of other pizza and sub shops in Phlly, about 20-25 minutes.
   We walked the ten minutes back to his place and prepared to dig in. Even with the walk the calzones were still plenty hot and the cheese inside was better than any other shop I've had recently. We've been back several times and so far no disappointments. If the Phillies or Eagles are playing they are busier and wait times are, naturally, longer. Definitely worth a tryExcellent pizza.  Crust was perfectly cooked. Also had a nice experience with the man at the counter, presumably the owner or manager.This place has some of the best white pizza I've ever had. If you order it for pick up, it will be hot AF! Don't be like the hipster who burnt his mouth because he ate the pizza before it was cool.After a year of not ordering I decided to give them another try. From the time I ordered until my pizza and fries arrived it took an hour and a half. The food was cold and soggy. NEVER again. Also I can understand if it was a Friday or Saturday night but this was in the afternoon. I called and was told it was on it's way and it still took 45 minutes.Not Just Pizza is a takeout place in South Philly. You might know them from the silly commercials featuring a random penguin happily proclaiming that "Sal's Back" in a complete, total and funny ripoff of the Aflac Duck. 
Anyway, NJP (as the kids call it) is an above average and consistent pizza place, which is saying a lot more than 95% of the places in Philadelphia.  The pizza is closer to thin crust, so if that's your thing check it out. Also, it comes with a garlic sauce on the side. Sometimes I use this, sometimes not. It's aight. 
I have a few standards on the menu. The jalapeno poppers are outrageous; my favorite in the world. The difference is that they use cream cheese, making it truly decadent. The sandwiches are OK, nothing special and nothing really interesting ingredient-wise. I like the steaks better than Steak Em Up (NJP's chief South Philly pizza rival) but still not up to Philly standards. 
My fiance loves the eggplant parm sandwiches and I must say, they look damn good when she gets them. She also loves the mozzerella sticks, because "they're the fat ones." Yeah, shes dirty like that. 
Lastly, they deliver groceries and stuff, apparently. I don't know to what extent but next time I need some milk and we are getting NJP, I will certainly test the waters on this.Awesome pizza. I enjoyed home style pizza. Generous portion literally. lot of hot gooey cheese.That was the worst cheesesteak pizza I have ever had. Extremely disappointed. Who puts slices of cheese over pizza? This was my first time ordering from here and my last time. I would go elsewhere. Absolutely terrible and disrespectfulI was actually really disappointed with this place. Even though the reviews are not wonderful, I had high hopes. We ordered the fried mac & cheese for an app which actually was good but needed salt. I ordered chicken and waffles and SEVEN minutes after I placed the order the gentleman came out and apologized at the waffle machine was never turned on for the day and that my meal will take a little bit longer. My boyfriend meal came out 20 minutes before mine he was completely done eating by the time I actually got my meal. It was a pretty disappointing experience as our entr√©es were just OK. My server was nice, but that's about it. I will not return to this establishmentThe wings are disgusting!!!! The pizza is so so. Definitely not a place I would order from again. What tempted us into trying this place was the cheap prices. What we discovered was that the prices are simply a reflection of their food... Cheap.This place is a joke and I'm shocked they're still in business. Had order through eat24 tonight and regret it. Delivery guy was rude and the food made me regret not cooking at home. Don't bother ordering wings especially if mild you will literally receive a cup of ketchup with table pepper mixed in. I have the pics as proof. My wrap was soggy and chicken was gross. So not only are you being deceived but you're going to be upset with the lack of resolution. The owner denied refund or redelivery. Then the horrible customer service from eat24. I'm just gonna cook more at home.This place is near my apartment so most of the time I usually call in to order and walk to pick it up.  The people are always so nice and they have a nice selection to pick from.  This is my go-to place for pizza when I'm too lazy to cook.Waited almost an hour and a half for delivery.  Ice cream was soupy, food cold and hard, my onion rings were smashed flat and were not crunchy or hot.  No ketchup, silverware, or straw(for the milkshake) included.  I threw away 80% of my order.  Sad to say that I won't be ordering again.Talk about around forever and still greatThis is the 2nd time I have had a problem with an order from this place. I ordered a white pizza and steak fries. Not only did it take 90 minutes (30 minutes more than they said), but they sent a red pie and the steak fries were leaking from the container. The pizza is not that good to start with, and having to deal with such incompetence, I will never order from here again.The more I try the menu the more likely I am to move this review to four stars. (Don't shoot me, I'm a tough critic and the fact that I'm reviewing them at all is testament to the fact that I think they're worth a try.)
The basic cheese pizza is fine but is a little on the "Greek" side (Philadelphia residents will immediately understand this).
Having read some positive reviews here about sandwiches, I decided to try one and wow am I glad I did.
The veggie hoagie is served hot, has a perfect amount of heat (not mentioned on the menu) and a tremendous addition of garlic (also not mentioned, but I'm not sure if that's the source of the heat ... I doubt it). 
The only thing I would say if that I don't believe the eggplant was fried as described but rather grilled ... and that's a VERY good thing! I just wish there was a little more of it. Regardless, I will definitely order again, maybe next time on a seeded roll. A legitimately good sandwich!
While I was too hungry to shoot the hoagie, here are the pizza fries. Great portion for the money, no skimping on the cheese, really can't complain. If you are a steak fry kind of person, these are just a tad smaller so you get the idea.
One last bit and that's the customer service. I've only been in two or three times (I'm close enough to pick up rather than have it delivered) and these folks have been gracious and friendly each and every time.
If I'd stuck with the pizza, I might not have come back for the sandwiches but I'm so glad I did. I'll be back, and will try some of the other offerings on their rather extensive menu.Ordered from here and my food was sent to the wrong house (which whatever shit happens, it's Saturday so I understand) Don't you know my neighbor accepted the foos she knew she did not pay for and ate it?! Who even does that?! How cheap!  Anyways my review is about the phone girl, I loved her! She was so funny about it and went to the neighbors house and got her money back! (Go you girl!) If it wasn't for her making me laugh, I'd be pissed but yeah..give her a raise her customer service is amazing!Love their homestyle pizza - the sauce is on top of the cheese. By far my favorite delivery pizza in the city.They switched to frozen dough . So I just got a fronzen pizza delivered . This was my go to spot , but they just tanked biggggg time !I would post a Negative Star if it was possible!!! I ordered through GrubHub a tomato pie and garden salad. The order showed up over an hour late. Each time I called the place they told me it was on its way. It arrives ice cold and covered in CHEESE!! I now have to throw it out since I am allergy to dairy. I thought that may be my garden salad would be ok, nope! I open the bag and half the salad had spilled out of the box all over the inside of the bag. It worst food experience in my life!!!!I ordered 3 tomato and cheese pizzas with toppings through their online website and they said it didn't show the whole order onto their computer. So I received 3 tomato pies with toppings. When I called to tell them of the mistake I was told I ordered wrong. My order which I had a screenshot of clearly said tomato and cheese pizza and I was still told it was my fault and I ordered wrong and that I should have called. Why the heck do you have an online website to order from if it isn't right. The woman that I first spoke to was very rude and she passed the phone over to a man who was also rude and I could still hear the woman complaining through the phone. The worst costumer service for something that was clearly their fault and I am assuming they just didn't read the whole order and then blamed me. I will definitely not order from them again..It's hard to give an accurate review when your food never shows up. You down with NJP ? Hell no, not me.We ordered some pizzas on Saturday night from here through GrubHub. I think we've ordered here before, but I didn't remember how it was like so we ordered from here again. A cheese, pepperoni, bbq chicken, and an order that was supposed to be half mushroom and half onions and peppers. They put all the ingredients on one side instead of half half. and the other half was cheese. I ordered a cheese pizza already, so I really didn't need another half of just cheese. Anyway, pepperoni was ok. The cheese on each pizza also looked so different. Some had that bubbly cheese crispness and the others just had like white melted cheese. BBQ sauce was not good - too tangy and the chicken looked like cut up breaded chicken. The crust on the pizza just didn't have the fresh pizza dough taste. 
I can only imagine how difficult it is for businesses to run with so much competition around, but pizza is such a quintessential Philly favorite. Why can't we just use simple quality ingredients?! Maybe pizza isn't their forte?
Overall, not a fan and ordering 2nd time has confirmed that we will not be back again.Living in South Philly there are always good places to order from or just try - hadn't ordered from NJP in several years, figured we'd give it a shot since our regular places had started to decline in both quality and service. 
So far my wife and I have ordered several dinner meals (Cheesesteaks, Burgers, Mozz Sticks, fries, etc) - and personally I ordered breakfast a week or so ago (amazing). Have to say beyond the food (which has been great) - the drivers are super friendly, never an issue - and the only time something came incorrectly, they rushed asap to correct it. This has turned into our go to for anything outside of a "pizza"I am a new resident to So Philly and we found their menu in our mail and figured we would give them a try. The 1st time we ordered from there it took an hour. The burger my boyfriend ordered was a very nice size, the sausage sandwich i ordered was really small and I was still hungry after I ate it. 
We figured we would give the place a second chance...again took an hour. The delivery guy pulls up in a smokey car smoking (I don't want to know you smoke with my food in your car). I ordered a cheese steak "pizza" style. I ended up getting a pizza cheese steak style. It was so late by the time we got out food I just ate it (nothing to write home about)...along with the fact that for a burger and what I thought was a cheese steak I spent over $30!!!! WTF?!?
All I can say is I will not be ordering from there anytime soon. :( ...and to find out they are only a few minutes from my house I still can't figure out why it would take over an hour. Maybe they need some more drivers (non-smoking prefered).I placed a delivery order through grubhub. Absolutely horrible. Driver lied to me and told me my drink was in the bag so I would accept the order. I ordered a milkshake. It was not in the bag. I would not have accepted an incomplete order but I was lied to. I called the restaurant and they didn't apologize. They said they would send the milkshake right over. I waited 45 mins before calling Grubhub. The milkshake never came. No one apologized. The food was not good. Why was my cheesesteak so salty? I do not recomend. Listen to the reviews. They do not deserve your business with customer service like this. I won't waste my money here again.By far the best pizza in the neighborhood. They were the best in the first place but then my wife made a special request.  I got limited teeth and she asked them if they could make the crust a little bit softer and they did!  That's when they turned they're already delicious pizza into a bonafide heavenly oraficial treat.  THANK YOU NOT JUST PIZZA!I ordered in from NJP after reading good reviews here.  I got a Romano and a Home Style pizza. 
The Romano was pretty good - I was a little disappointed about the lack on basil on it though.  It's listed as an ingredient on the menu, but the pizza just had a sprinkling of dried basil flakes.  I had expected lots of fresh basil from the description.  But aside from that, it was still quite tasty.  
The Home Style.... so good!  I LOVED it - a thick layer of cheese and delicious sauce.  What's not to like??  I'm glad I ordered a large - I can't wait to eat more of it for breakfast tomorrow!Ordered on a rainy Sunday and got the food in about 45 or 50 minutes.  Extra large 18" plain cheese pie only $10 bucks.  The garden salad is a good accompaniment with lots of toppings (cherry tomatoes, shredded carrots, cucumbers, black olives, a hard boiled egg) at only $6.  I also ordered 20 wings for $10.  The hot sauce was tasty, has a good kick.  The wings were meaty and crispy.  Solid and inexpensive place for takeout pizza as well as "not just pizza."  We will be ordering again.I ordered a hoagie with lettuce tomato American cheese sweet peppers and a little mayo. The first time  I received a hoagie with cheese sweet peppers and onions. I printed on paper what I wanted so there would be no issue. I walked it back and had them remake it. Their second try yielded an Italian hoagie. Still wrong. Not even close to what I ordered. You're not going to survive as a business if your cook can't assemble a sandwich correctly. I will be ordering from one of the other twenty or so competitors in the neighborhood and avoiding this place.Not Just Pizza just lost my business for good. For the past year we've had issues with our orders -- wrong, cold, missing items, etc. But it was always just like one little thing; one order has the wrong side or the appetizer sampler shorted us a few items... so we let it slide, because we've been ordering from them for almost 5 years without issue, recommended to us by people who'd been using them for even longer. Today I called because we finally felt the need to say something when our food arrived cold again. I called and asked to speak to a manager, and proceeded to wait on hold for several minutes. Again, trying to give them the benefit of the doubt that they were just busy or the manager was in the middle of something. As soon as the manager got on with me, he was rude and clearly already on the defensive. I told him that for about the past year we've had little but consistent issues, tried giving them the benefit of the doubt, but now we felt we needed to let them know that the quality isn't where it was.  I was calling because we still like their food and hoped the service could turn around. He began talking at me and over me, about how few times I had ordered from them (three or so times in the past 12 months, he said, based on my phone number). I told him that, for one thing, we don't only order to our own home and for another we have multiple phone numbers that call from this house. But, that wasn't my point. I tried to explain that we're long time customers and that, rather than take to the internet to complain, I was hoping to notify someone who might want to address it. I was trying to do the right thing, and told him as much. He then began raising his voice at me and talking over me saying that he was looking at his computer right now and seeing that I, "always call them and give them this same song and dance," that I could, "go ahead and write on Yelp, its a free country, hun," and that he, "didn't care if I never order from them again." I said that I've honestly never called to complain, so that was completely untrue. He tried to change his story and decided to go with, "I didn't say that, I said everyone complains about the food, everyone calls with the same song and dance you're giving me. So don't call us, don't order from here, then. You don't have to order here anymore, sweetheart." I will be honest and say that the, "hun," ticked me off and the condescening, "sweetheart" pushed me over the edge. I'll admit my fault on that one; I called him an **expletive for a rear end** and hung up. I am furious that I was spoken to in such a condescending way, but I'm writing this review to express what utter lack of quality and customer service this place now has. I really didn't plan to take the "angry review" route, but this was downright disrespectful on top of poor quality of the product and service. It was once a really great takeout place, it was my favorite by a long shot for years. But I won't stand for ignorance and I won't stand for their obvious lack of interest for the customer's concerns and attempts to help them right the ship. What a shame, really, that this is what's happened to the place.I have continued to order from here, trying different things, and the menu continues to impress, with the same great service and tremendous value.How are they still in business??? Food was horrible  probably one of the worst places to get pizza in Philadelphia. I didn't enjoy this at all.Friendly staff and broad menu. These guys do cheesesteaks right! They are also very caring for my 86 year old grandfather, and are quick too!Please don't waste you money on a sandwich from here because you will be disappointed. I ordered an Italian hoagie with extra Mayo and received non at all. Also ordered a sweet Italian sausage with onions and peppers and only received half a sausage cut up and spaced out on the roll with no onions and peppers.I've only ever gotten delivery from here, and only ever pizza/calzones, but they are pretty freakin' good. They use fresh ricotta. They use real chunks of chicken breast. The mozzarella is creamy. The dough is the best I've had in South Philly, so I don't even abandon the crust on my plate like I usually do. 
Delivery is prompt and usually accurate. They've never brought the wrong thing, but the one time I paid over the phone with a credit card they double-billed me (eventually worked out). I'd recommend cash and a hearty appetite--one of their calzones is plenty for two people, or three lunches.
Their wings are awesome too.I was appalled Friday evening, 12/9/11, witnessing the terrible way one of the workers was treating three very sweet Asian woman who were trying to order food.  First he asks "Where the F are they all coming from?"  and then proceeds to go into the kitchen making karate sounds!  I have no doubt that he was not preparing their pizza according to the board of health guidlines as well!  Kudos to them for walking out and leaving the food behind.  For a restaurant that sells mediocre food this ignorant worker should be grateful for any customers that walk through the door!  Shame on the owner and manager for hiring such ignorant workers.Ordered delivery. Took a bite of my burger and realized that the bun was a really weird bright neon yellow color. I called the restaurant to ask what it was, (turmeric, food coloring, etc.) but was told they didn't know, nor were the ingredients on the bag. The woman I spoke with also let me know that they were really busy because it was dinner time! (As if they were too busy to address my question..) I knew that it was dinner time because I ordered dinner, but now it's in the garbage 'cause it looks nasty and I don't trust a restaurant that has no idea what they are serving, nor the time to find out.I have been a South Philly transplant living in West Philly for 10 years surrounded by "Greek pizza" & artisan "brick ovens", and hating it for years. If I wanted a real pizza, I would always have to order and then pick it up from South Philly. Until I finally realized tonight that there was one south philly pizzeria willing to delivery out by my way via Uber Eats honest to goodness pizza, and it was Not Just Pizza. I'll tell ya, the cheese pizza brought me back to my childhood of buying a single slice at the counter of the corner shop. And their inside outs are better than Florida Stlyes, trust me
Bravo you guys, especially for breaking out of the south philly shell to deliver to us guys out of that area
