I went to Hiro for lunch and got the special: $13 for ramen with salad and an appetizer. Great deal for the amount of food you get and how delicious it all is! I got the Vegetable Ramen and my brother got the Chicken Soy Ramen. We were the first people in just as the restaurant opened so we were served quickly and attentively. Unfortunately, we didn't know it was cash only but, no big deal, there's a bank right across the street! Overall, the food was great (one of the best ramen in Philly), our server was super friendly, and the ambiance of the place seems perfect for a ramen house.Just ate the Inch of Heaven in about 3 minutes!!!!! Friegen' Unbelievable!!!
Get here and eat!!!
Stopped in today for my second visit.
Tried the Gates of Hell and it is just as amazing as the Inch of Heaven.
The waitress here is very pleasant.
Can't wait to go back.Server got the order wrong. Waited over 30 mins and still didnt get the correct order. How long does it take to boil some noodles?! Left the place without having food.Just had my first ramen here and I have zero complaints. I had the $13 lunch special which included salad, an appetizer and ramen. I asked the waitress who was very friendly for recommendations and she recommended the Hiro's inch of Heaven!! Great choice for a newbie like me. The broth was very flavorful and the noodles were perfect!  The lunch salad was good and for the appetizer I got the Karaage (fried chicken) and it was delicious. I was stuffed by the time I left but I will be back again!! Great service during the lunch rush hourDon't know what the big fuss is about, my first time here, and many more to come.
I ordered the vegetable ramen. It was delicious. The right amount of salt, oil, vegetables and other seasonings. The ramen it self was of traditional ramen noodles. Also the ramen was well plated or should I say well bowled? Lol. 
The hostess and waitress are a pair of very attractive Asian ladies. The were very kind and stayed in eyesight if anything was needed. However, they are latently hungry for a tip. Typical for any hostess or waitress in a new restaurant.
5 stars and well earned!We've tried out quite a few ramen places in Philly (Nomnom, Terakawa, etc.), but this is by far our favorite.  My fave is the black pig (burnt garlic oil, mmmMmmMm) with an extra egg, and my husband's is the gates of hell (spicy!).  Both are deeeeeelicious, the broth is incredibly deep and flavorful, the pork just melts in your mouth, egg is perfectly soft-cooked.  We're also a fan of the fried chicken--big pieces that are fried to perfection, yummmm.  Also, Dan, the server, is so incredibly friendly and nice--he's just adorable.
To top it all off, lunch special = $12 for a small salad, small appetizer, and a bowl of ramen--I'm sold!Ramen is solid and location is extra convenient for me (extra star for that). It's tucked away behind Milkboy so it's hard to notice. Very easy to get seating later in evening, which is when I went today. Amazingly good fried karaage chicken which you must get, piping hot and super flavorful with dipping sauce. I've tried almost all the ramen varieties here, usually in take-out form unfortunately, and the Hiro Heaven and Black Pig are my favorites. A bit on the saltier side overall, not a bad thing, just remember to hydrate well :)Great price for the quantity and quality! Looked and tasted really authentic! However I felt like they were a little heavy handed on the soy sauce (maybe because I don't consume salt as much) but other than the food tasted great! I got the lunch combo for $12 and got a good 3 course meal! The salad was delicious and the chicken ramen which unfortunately and to my suprise had more pork than chicken in it but also had lots of different veggies inside (exciting right?!), the gyoza ( pork dumplings) on the other hand was drenched in soy! Would recommend if you like to discover new food! Also service was fast and our waitress was pretty nice!Some restaurants just need to meet a minimum standard of food quality to survive due to their geography.  Hiro Ramen House is one of those restaurants, located near the heart of Philadelphia next to several major academic institutions and hospitals.  Their food is in the $9-$12 range for a bowl of ramen which honestly had some redeeming parts but overarchingly came out to be about average.  I got a "Gates of Hell," which had all the heat and bite of a whimpering pup.  The noodle was miserable and in all likelihood from the corner asian supermarket.  Except for the egg which was very well made, the toppings were similarly lackluster and consisted of bamboo shoots, bean sprouts, and a sprinkle of green onion.  It truly seemed like they were present just for the sake of diversity in the bowl of ramen.  The broth was barely edging over acceptable and didn't have the deep rich flavor that all the top tier places have from simmering pork bones for literally half a day or longer.  The one redeeming factor for this ramen shop was the chasu, which was tender, lightly fatty, and had a strong, satisfying pork flavor.  
Hiro Ramen House is a place you go to after a tiring day of work, when the idea of waiting in line for 2 hours at a restaurant makes you seriously consider just going to sleep hungry.  It gives you food that has the components of ramen, as much as McDonalds gives you food that has the components of burgers.  But heck it feels much better to sit in a place with actual decent decor rather than a fast food restaurant after a long day of work.The king is dead. Long live the king. 
This place used to be my go-to ramen. Now after the newest menu changes, I don't think I can come in good conscience anymore. 
No more happy hour. Except for the boys who came in after me. What what? Server playing favorites??
Major unbundling of ramen contents. If you like egg on your noodles, it's now an add on to ALL ramen. Kind of sad. Spicy is also another add on. It's a touch ridiculous. 
No more employee discount. I can live with that. 
But this place had a special point. A good-great ramen for about $10. Now it's hard to get away with a bill less than 15. The increase is enough to send me to Terakawa Ramen until something changes...Muy rico Lugar, pintoresco y acogedor, el servicio excelente, pedí Inch of heaven y quede encantada!Really solid lunch special for $13 - a ramen, an app, and a salad.
Chicken karaage is great. 
Gates of hell ramen is pretty good too!
One of the few places I've discovered with a groupon that I will happily return to over and over again.Came in here for lunch on a summer Tuesday afternoon with a friend. One table with a couple of friends and someone eating alone. It isn't very big, but set up to give you the same vibe as a ramen bar in Japan.
First starters we ordered the Kaarage chicken. The chicken is fried to a good crisp. The lemon and dipping sauce for the chicken were good, but something is missing from the batter they coat the chicken in before frying it. This appetizer gets a 3.8/5 from me. Not something I would order all the time from here.
For our meal with both ended up getting the Gates of Hell Ramen, which comes with spicy hot chili Berkshire pork broth, cha su, bamboo, and seasoned egg. I have to say the broth is very flavorful. The noodles were perfect. And Oh My God the cha su was cooked perfect. Soft and full of flavor. I was only disappointed that thought it was a large piece, it was thinly slice. One thinly sliced piece for my $10 bowl of noodles. The egg was the definition of what a seasoned egg should be. I give the ramen itself a 4.5/5.
Overall this place has a solid 4 from me. I would definitely come back here again when in this part of the city.So yummy! One of my favorite foods in the world is ramen, but I usually eat the packaged variety. We ordered the lunch special - for $12, you get a house salad, appetizer, and ramen. The house salad had that tasty miso dressing I love. Appetizers I got to try were the gyoza (fried dumpling) and the fried chicken. Both tasted home made and fresh/crisp. For the ramen, we asked for the spiciest dishes. My husband ordered the Gates of Hell and I got the Porfirio (sp?). It looked exactly the same except the Gates of Hell was spicier and the Porfirio had a piece of lemon. We finished off our bowls. Definitely coming back.Stopped in for a late snack and this hit the spot.  We almost didn't find the restaurant as there is not much signage and is small.  They are cash only.  Menu is simple and inexpensive.  Our food came out quick and was very tasty.Great Raman spot. Go there for lunch regularly, there lunch special is great. Salad, small plate and Raman for $13 can't be beat. It's no frills but the quality is there. Simple, quick and the price is rightReally cozy, cute ramen shop - the veggie ramen and fried chicken were delicious! Will definitely be coming back again!One of my boyfriend's favorite places! We both got the lunch special (salad, ramen, small app) for $13. A great deal! He got Hiro's Inch of Heaven and I got the Gates of Hell. Both were wonderful, the broth was delicious. The noodles were well cooked and the karaage was amazing. Portions were perfect, not too much food. We both left satisfied but not too full so we could do some walking after. 
The waitress was very sweet and attentive. Would recommend!Great Ramen.  The pork slices were tender and flavorful, but my absolute favorite is a tie between the broth and the marinated egg.  Very Light delicate broth wonderfully adorned with a marinated halved soft boiled agg.  Tasty and at this point in the year thoroughly appropriate ^-^This hidden Center City (never thought those words could go together) ramen joint beat Terakawa for me. Everytime I go to Terakawa, there's a killer wait. Here, there was no wait and the food arrived almost immediately. The prices are great for Center City (around $10 for ramen, $13 for the lunch special - ramen plus salad plus a side.) The portion may be a bit smaller than Terakawa's, but I prefer the more reasonable size. 
I ordered the Inch of Heaven, which had a shoyu broth base. It was very pleasant and the pork and egg were tender as well. The noodles were well-textured and didn't have the issue of being clumped together. I tried my friend's Gates of Hell, though, which was even better because it had the added complexity of spicy (bone?) broth. 
The waiter was kind enough to keep refilling our water and even my water bottle upon request. The only thing about this place is that it is **cash-only**. Don't forget this. And do check it out.I don't care what the reviewers say, My fiance and I never had a less than stellar meal here.  It's his favorite Ramen in the city, and it's so very hard to pry him away from this option when i want to try other places in the city. 
I absolutely love their crispy chicken app -- as compared to other ramen places i've ordered from recently, their's is by far the best.  Love the dippins for it too.   Even though i know i shouldn't order anything more than a big Ramen bowl,  My fiance and I still have to order the chicken to share, because it's that good.
Our favorites are the gates of hell and the heaven bowls?  I forget.  One is spicy - the hell obviously, and the other not.  They're both so amazing that i can't ever deter myself away from those 2 options and share each bowl.  
I did on the last visit try the chicken and pork  ramen and that was also great.
Service is super nice here too.My favorite ramen place in the city. I'm pretty basic, noodles and broth are really all I need for a good time. The shoyu ramen broth is to die for!!!Came here for a power hour lunch after my sales appointment. Sat down by myself at the bar. It was fun watching the chefs bicker at each other after a miscue of an order that was placed before me. Nothing wrong with a bit of team chemistry flair with my lunch!
But, wow, the chicken shoyu broth was everything I had imagined. Fatty, flavorful and just pure sexy. 
The noodles were cooked just as I wanted. Not overdone, just on the crunchier side. It was only $9 too! But given that I have tried other ramen joints in NYC, this place could compete for a brief moment. Wished they had given me more noodles, but it is what it is for $9. 
Will I come back? HECK YA!I enjoyed my meal here. Had the lunch special which includes a salad, appetizer, and choice of ramen for $13. I thought everything was delish and the service was great. Will definitely return.Just ate the Inch of Heaven in about 3 minutes!!!!! Friegen' Unbelievable!!!
Get here and eat!!!Have been in Philly for over 10 years and watched the ramen shops pop up one by one - this is definitely my favorite place for a hot bowl of noodles.  The Inch of Heaven is rich and flavorful, and has a unique taste that reminds me of ramen I used to eat growing up in Asia.  The lunch special is a great deal, and please do yourself a favor and get the fried chicken because it is perfection (crispy on the outside and tender, juicy inside).Just hype- tastes like any other ramen place. In addition the chicken appetizer everyone keeps raving about is bland with chunks of explosive fat fried in itThis place is always awesome. I highly recommend the Black Pig and the fried chicken. The place is small, but cozy. The decor is nice. The ramen is just amazing.I had always wondered what this place was because from the outside, I just wasn't sure. 
Met up with a friend for dinner and had the fried chicken appetizer to share. She got the inch of heaven and I ordered the gates of hell. 
The gates of hell was delicious and spicy and my friend really enjoyed the inch of heaven. The prices are good (our bill was $27 in total) which I was happy about and the setup of the place is pretty cool. 
I also appreciate the fact that the bathrooms are pretty clean and spacious because I usually hate public restrooms and this one I didn't mind so much.I am extremely picky with ramen (spent some time working in Tokyo and have had ramen across both coasts in California and the east coast) and this was one of the best I've had in Philadelphia. The broth is generally most important to me and it had a depth of flavor that I like. However, it was EXTREMELY salty. I am used to ramen being salty as that is fairly common, but this was pushing it a bit. In addition, the egg yolk wasn't quite as runny as I usually like, really pushing hard-boiled. 
The waitress was very nice. I had the lunch special (ramen + salad + small plate for $13) and it came out in a confusing order (ramen, salad, then the karaage, and with a large amount of time in between each) but it wasn't a big deal to me. It is indeed cash only, but the prices include tax. In addition, I would not come here with more than 4 person groups because the space isn't really set up for large groups.they don´t serve a wide variety of ramens there, so you can just stick to the few options. However, they are pretty decent, and with the affordable price, the ramens are really good. I just wish that the noodle house can serve a bit more kinds of food there, such as desserts.I was in the mood for ramen and was in the area, so I decided to go here. First of all, the exterior of the restaurant makes it seem incredibly mysterious. The name of the restaurant in the front is only written in kanji, with no English letters indicating what the restaurant is. It does cause a lot of people to peer in the window though, so maybe the mysteriousness works for them? Also note, right now they only accept cash and do not do delivery! The interior of the restaurant was clean, cozy, and quite quaint. 
In terms of service, it was fine, no complaints about it. Ramen came out in in a timely manner and the waitress was nice. Although the restaurant was completely devoid of customers at around 5pm, so I wouldn't expect less from the waitress seeing that there was no one else to attend to.
Now to the important part, the food! The menu itself is quite limited at the moment, with only four types of ramen bowls, a few appetizers, and some drinks. I'd note that the pictures of the ramen they use on their menu are probably not pictures they took themselves because the ramen didn't come out with exactly the same toppings as what the picture indicates.... (Like there is corn in the picture, but the actual ramen did not come with corn itself.) 
I got the shoyu (chicken soy) ramen. It comes with one piece of cha-siu, half of an ajitsuke seasoned egg, some bamboo shoots, a piece of seaweed, and of course the noodles. I must say, their ajitsuke egg was seasoned quite good, I thought it was delicious, but unfortunately there was only half of one. The cha-siu was pretty thin and semi tough, not as soft as Japanese cha-siu should be. They also use prepackaged noodles and do not make their own hand drawn ramen, so there isn't anything to rave about for the noodles - they were pretty standard. But I guess for $9, I shouldn't be expecting much or comparing their ramen to places like Ippudo in NYC where it's $17+ per bowl. 
My main qualm with this shoyu ramen is the broth. I found it overly salty, almost to the point where I didn't want to drink any of the broth with the ramen... I'm not sure if this is a consistency issue or how their shoyu broth normally tastes, but I definitely was not a big fan of it and would not eat it again if the taste remains the same. 
Overall, I think Hiro Ramen House definitely has some potential to flourish if they refine their food some. But from the first bowl of ramen I had here, I think for now I prefer the taste of ramen from Ramen Bar near University City over Hiro Ramen House.
TLDR Version: Ramen came out promptly. Ramen bowl itself was overall very average, except for the halved seasoned egg that was really tasty. The shoyu ramen broth was wayyyy too salty which I did not like. Overall this place has potential to grow, but needs to fix some of their menu items.I have been in Philadelphia for a while and I loved Terakawa Ramen so i wanted to see more ramen places in philly. I'm someone who doesn't eat pork so i asked for chicken substitute but they don't carry much chicken substitute which sucks. If you want more chicken options i wouldn't come here. I tried their chicken soy and it was ok; it wasn't the best ramen i ever had but it filled me up. This place is cheap and i ordered a drink and dessert with my ramen and the total came to be $16. I could say it was worth the price, but still not the best. I guess don't go into this restaurant hoping for the best just something cheap and can fill you up.Went to Hiro with my aunt for the first time on a tuesday afternoon. I gotta say, I think I like Hiro more than Terakawa. My aunt and I, both, order Gates of Hell and shared a takoyaki app. The ramen came before the appetizer which I didn't really mind too much but wished it came first cause I was almost done my meal when it came out. You know that feeling you get when you want to eat a certain thing but instead eat something else because it was unavailable at the time. But then after you eat what was available, the item you really wanted becomes available but you don't really want it anymore, (no, just me?) Basically, I forgot about it and so did my appetite.
Back to why I like Hiro better, their broth is better. It's not as fatty and has a better depth of flavor. Their charsu also taste better, sadly they only give you one slice. But better one good piece then 2 mediocre pieces, imo. Gates of Hell isn't that spicy despite the scary name which I was slightly disappointed at. Still good and will order again.
The takoyaki kinda disappointed me because there was only 5 and had a (uncomplimentary) salad mix that had no dressing so I question if it was useless garnish or if I was suppose to eat it together. I was hungry so the latter happened.
The portions are kinda small and it did leave my aunt leaving not really full. I was okay but I would be in the same position if I didn't eat the takoyaki.I think this place serves the best ramen in town.  And their lunch special for $12 is a great deal - a salad, a choice of kara-age/gyoza/edamame, and your choice of ramen.  The chicken broth was nice and light, and their berkshire pork broth was nice and rich.  I heard that it's MSG-free, and if it is, then that would make this place even more special.Simple, no fluff, SOLID food. $13 lunch special: crispy fried chicken app, salad, spicy juicy pork ramen. Everything is MSG free.
Health report and other food safety reviews are concerning though.This is a really good and authentic impression of a Japanese ramen shop! I went with some family and was impressed by both the service and the food. The place is small and unassuming (you might miss it if you aren't careful!), but worth a visit!
We got a couple different kinds of ramen, pretty basic choices but both were very good - perfectly cooked noodles and excellent broth. The takoyaki was flavorful and fresh, and edamame, though not my favorite, got rave reviews from the rest of my family.Very chill place to grab a quick ramen bowl. The interior is definitely reminiscent of ramen shops I grew up visiting. Located super close to city hall and Jefferson, it's super accessible. That said, it's $10 for the average ramen bowl - kind of pricey for it's small portion. Extra toppings are $3 each (like the 4 slices of naruto in my photo). Also, it's cash only, so don't forget to visit the ATM if you don't usually carry cash.
Can't give Hiro full stars, but I wouldn't mind going back if I'm in the area.If you want affordable, good ramen, Hiro Ramen House is the place to go.
The portions are not bad, not too small, not too big. 
Went here with my friend, we started with an appetizer: Karaage Fried Chicken **must get**
Thought the chicken is going to be dry, but nope. It was juicy and this was a huge plus. 
As for the ramen, I got the Hiro Inch of Heaven, while he got the Portfilio. 
The Inch of Heaven, similiar to tonkotsu ramen, is definitely a must try for anybody. Aesthetic-wise was a plus, and the filling was just right.  Similarly, the Portfilio was astonishingly great, described by my friend. 
Definitely coming to this place again in the future !Tried their Pig and Miso Ramen for only 10 bucks. Sooo delish and perfect for the cold months! They don't use salt and MSG yet it is soooo tasty. The pork was juicy and tender. Waiter was very nice and friendly! Love the experience.Hiro is by FAR the best spot for Ramen in Philadelphia!
The various kinds of broth are all fantastic!
The eggs are perfect!
The pork is delicious!
Priced better than most of the places in Philly, the lunch special is a great deal!
Go here. Spread the word. This is the hot spot!!!Cozy place with great gyoza and ramen (gates of hell). Would surely go back to try the fried chicken and other ramen.
FYI, BYOB and Cash only.
Highly recommendedI live literally a block away and love coming to this place. I would highly suggest this place over other places like Ramen Bar and Terakawa Ramen (Not that those places are necessarily bad). I love the Hiro's Inch of Heaven (soy sauce broth w/ pork belly) and the Gates of Hell (great 
 for clearing your sinuses).  
Pro-tip:
-Cash only (atm inside)
-BYOBDisappointed. My husband and I got there at exactly 9:30 on Saturday night and they turned us down telling us that they were "out of noodles". Yea, sure. Don't advertise that your business closes at 10 when clearly you're not. Wasted time and gas.Hiro Ramen House is a hidden ramen gem in Center City. I go the lunch special which got me a salad, a small appetizer and a bowl of delicious and scrumptious ramen for $13! What a deal!  This delightful Ramen house is intimate, cozy, and it transports you into what feels like a wooden den in the middle of Japan. Im a big fan and recommend it if youre looking for some traditional Ramen where you can bring some of your own booze! (BTW ITS CASH ONLY!)
And now, the FAPS breakdown:
Food - Food was spectacular. I had the inch of heaven ramen, with a small side salad and edamame. Salad and edamame were pretty standard and tasted pretty awesome. The Inch of heaven ramen was supreme! The broth had excellent flavor and felt a little thicker to other Ramens Ive had. The pork was crispy, rich and mixed well with the ramen.
Ambiance - Theres no real sign in front of this place and I didnt even realize it was a restaurant until recently. Located next to milkboy, this small establishment is for some casual intimate dining and honestly wouldnt recommend more than four of you going at a time. It has beautiful wood surrounding the restaurant and seating at the bar and a few tables. They make good use of the small space and the decor is very well done!
Price - $$ - each bowel of ramen was 10 bucks and the appetizers were about 5 bucks. I felt pretty full after the meal, but not overly so. As with many Japanese restaurants, they did a solid job with portion control and gave me just enough to comfortable. The real steal is in the lunch special if you can make it! Just a heads up, its CASH ONLY. 
Service - The waitress was on the ball, even as the restaurant slowly drew in the lunch crowd, she was more than experienced to handle the different orders being thrown at her.This is the best Japanese ramen house I ever been to in America. The ramen soup is really flavorful. My favorite is the Gates of Hell. If you like spicy food, you will like it for sure. I recommend this ramen place to all of my friends ever since my first time visit. If I live in Philadelphia, I'm sure I would become a usual customer.I eat at Hiro about once every two weeks and the ramen is amazing.  I always order the black pig and it never disappoints.  Best ramen joint in Philadelphia in my opinion.Having lived in NY for a while and having Ippudo as my standard in Japanese ramen, I was doubtful yet hopeful in finding a solid ramen place in Philly. 
Hiro Ramen happened to be just down the street from my apartment so ideal location in midtown village. My husband and I have been to Ramen bar (our top place prior to Hiro), Cheu Noodle Bar (ramen - bad, but small plates good), Nom Nom (solid, good ramen), so here's our assessment of Hiro:
Ramen: Spicy Miso and Spicy Tonkasu
- Broth - flavorful, just spicy enough, and rich. Prefer the Miso broth over Tonkasu
- Noodles - chewy, slightly al dente than ramen that i've had in other ramen places, but good. Quantity-wise, they give you a healthy, hearty portion of noodles
- Toppings - more provincial and simple than other ramen house but yummy and fits well with the broth. Spicy Miso even comes with sweet corn and mixed greens, 2 toppings that I haven't encountered with Ramen yet. There's a list of add-in topping as well from extra pork, egg, etc
Side Plates:
- Takoyaki - delicious, flavorful, perfect amount of sauces and seasoning
- Pork Gyoza: plump and yummy, but not a big fan of the lemon over it
Overall:
Really hearty, flavorful, satisfying ramen that rivals Ramen bar or Nom Nom -- we think the broth kicks both their butts but slightly prefer the noodles at Ramen bar more. It's our go-to ramen spot now so YOU MUST CHECK IT OUT!
NOTE:
- Cash Only
- BYOB (but you can a free beer or sake serving with an order of a side plate (great deal/idea)Tiny authentic place with decent bowl of ramen, but the tonkotsu broth didn't quite have the depth of flavor needed for a memorable ramen, the slice of pork belly should have been a bit more tender, and some of the noodles were clumped.  Good service and fairly priced ($10 for a bowl), but we will stick with Nom Nom when we need a ramen fix in the area.Awesome ramen place. Went there on a Saturday afternoon with high expectations after reading the ramen road article in the Philly inquirer. Service was quick and polite. Restaurant was clean. Food was tasty and cheap. Short and simple review. Expectations met. Will be coming here again.Enjoyed the gates of hell ramen.  I definitely agree with a previous reviewer that the ramen broth is less thicker than Terakawa ramen in Chinatown.  It is on the pricier side but wouldn't mind going back!If you are a true foodie, you would not like the ramen here. The quality of the noodle is comparable to instant ramen. The noodle is not fresh or hand drawn. The egg looks day old. Though I must say the service is good. They are very quick preparing the food. I must say that I would not pay more than $5 for a bowl of noodles. The gyoza is excellent. You may want to get two orders (gyoza) because the proportion is very small. I would go back just for the appetizer. Definitely pass on the ramen though. It does not matter how good the broth is when the ramen is sub par!!Had the Potstickers, Gates of Hell ramen. It was really tasty. The flavors were sublime. Highly recommend this everyone.I wanted something spicy,  so I tried the gates of hell.  It was not spicy at all but the broth and noodles were good.   I also had the side of the fried chicken.   Such a great deal for only $13.Wow, best ramen soup I've had in a long time. The lunch special is a great deal: fried chicken or gyoza appetizer, salad and ramen bowl for $13. Cash only. Great wait staff!Will be hard to find competition! Very good! Probably 5-8 options but plenty of additions to spice things up! $10 bowl. Easy 4 stars. byob.About time!  I'm a noodle and dumpling freak.  Fresh noodles and belly/heart warming broth that will soothe the soul... Short menu but excited to see how they will expand and offer more selection!!! Basic ramen is one of the best I've had. 10000000000x better than instant.Hidden gem. I live around the corner and didn't even realize it was here because it doesn't look like much from the entrance, but great ramen, great atmosphere, and great service!Cash only at least when I went. They have a range of ramen dishes. The burnt scallions (deliberately so) are a nice combo with their soft boiled (also deliberately) egg. 
The noodles are al dente or as I call them "awesome". Only seats about 20 or so people with picnic style benches. 
Quick service. And noodles. Both good.Place was great the chicken karragae was cheap and plentiful. The gates of hell Ramen was superb. However the Gyoza was less than average and the fact they don't accept cash was bogus but because of how good the food was definitely bring cash and be coming again.This place is a gem. Delicious and affordable - what more do you need.
Ramen was excellent (thick and robust broths, flavorful meat) and priced on the cheaper end for the quality you get ($10-12ish). We also got karaage, which was a perfect balance of fried batter and juicy chicken meat. With a squeeze of lemon... so so good. 
Some things to note:
- cash only (ATM inside)
- possibly on the smaller side in terms of seating capacity
Can't wait to come back!The miso ramen was delicious and creamy. The tonkatsu ramen was good but had more of a pork soup base. The waiter was friendly and the service was quick! I would definitely go back.Anyone who gives Hiro less than 5 stars is playing themselves--and you as a yelp reader.
Their ramen is super good. Like really damn good. Prices are fair for what you get. Not cheap, but not super taxed. Fair.
They have the cool asian soda's with the ball that make it fizz up all crazy, and taste like a better version of sprite. Not sure the name of the brand, but I love those damn soda's. Perfect with the ramen.
Only downside is cash only. But get your bands up, and bring $15 and eat like a king.We were starving and really looking forward to trying Hiro.  
Turned out to be disappointing and simply bad.  
Both Miso and Spicy Tonkotsu Ramen broths were bland and lacking depth.  Where is the cloudy, developed broth that we were craving for? The Spicy broth was the worse of the two we ordered.  Tasted like hot oil was mixed in at the last minute and not the spicy, rich, porky bowl of goodness that it was supposed to be. Perhaps the owners should take a field trip to NYC to get some tips at Minca, Ippudo or Totto Ramen.   
The Gyoza was awful.  Poorly executed, not even the slightest crisp to the bottom of the Gyoza.   Skin was rubbery and inedible instead... hopefully not what the chef intended and just a bad day.  We had a gyoza each and couldn't even finish the remaining ones.  
Zero Stars for the food but 1 star for the server who was friendly and had a great smile.The 2nd best ramen in the city.*
*See Cheu NoodleKey Word - Underwhelming.
Friends raved about this place so I thought I would check it out.
However I still can not fathom what the big deal is.
1. The menu needs some working out - or something. 
2. The food is OK. Nothing exciting. 
3. People were raving about this place but alas - I fail to see it or in fact to taste it
I would have to say take a pass and go elsewhere. 
Bathrooms were clean.still amazing!
the pig and miso ramen is my fave bc its closest to the "traditional" ramen with pork based tonkotsu flavor plus miso. 
if you have the chance to go for lunch, they have a great special - instead of $10-12 for a bowl of ramen, for $13 you get a house salad, an appetizer like fried chicken or gyoza (dumplings), and a bowl of ramen! got it today, it was great :)i love ramen, and this place specializes in ramen. 
i used to go to nom nom ramen when i lived over near rittenhouse sq, but this is my new fave place. its delicious! 
ive gone 3 times and liked it each time. 
very nice people overall.
planning on going again this week :)$10 for a bowl of ramen but not many toppings. I got Pig and Miso and there was one thin slice of chashu and some veggies. The flavors were great though, and the service was very fast. I came in during weekday lunch it was easy to find a spot. Cash only but they have ATM. Overall the value is about the same as other ramen places because the quantity is small but I would definitely come here again.Very nice ambiance. Excellent ramen noodle. Gate of hell ramen noodle has a real kick to it!The exterior has boarded windows, a small curtain with Japanese characters, and a neon "open" sign. Not much too look at but it's like a ramen speakeasy!
Inside is a comfortable environment with small tables and bar seating. No frills, just a nice friendly place to sit with friends and enjoy good ramen.
I had the "1 inch of Heaven" --a pork tonkatsu based broth with all the trimmings. It was rich and flavorful and the noodles were perfect! Gyoza was fresh and well prepared. 
Great for kids and small groups, quick and courteous service.Stopped by for an early dinner and was relatively happy.  Things were quiet in the small space, and we enjoyed the "Whole Inch of Happiness" and the "Black Pig" bowls.  Happiness was a little sad--not quite hot enough, and the soft-boiled egg was a nice idea, but soaked a little too long in broth.  The Black Pig was better, hotter, and the roast pork swirl on top was excellent--just right in its texture and flavor.  Staff were friendly and prompt.Just had the Portfilio Ramen and Gyoza.  Very flavorful rich broth.  Pork and egg were done perfectly.  Great flavor...ramen 5 stars, dumpling 4 stars.  Great service and easy to get in, eat, and get out.  Quieter restaurant- good for conversation.  Overall an enjoyable food experience.I ordered Gates to Hell and it was great! My friends and I really enjoyed and I really want to give 5 stars for the noodles here! BUT the waitress girl was not behaving in a professional manner, and destroyed our happiness dining here.
When I ask if we could pay together with one card, she said they only accept cash indifferently. That's ok, but when we paid the noodles (pay for food first then pay the tip), she thought we didn't pay enough tips and came back requiring us to pay at least 15% to 20% tip. The way she said was rude, and inappropriate, and deserved no tips. We eventually paid her the amount she wants, but we are not coming back again, even if we really like the noodle here. We don't want to pay for any unpleasure.Came here after a friend sent me a daily meal article ranking the restaurant as #9 best in the states. I'm not a ramen aficionado or expert but I've tried ramen in NYC, Cali, NJ, and even Japan. After trying the Gates of Hell ramen today, I can understand why it deserved a spot on that list. I got the lunch special for $13 which included the ramen, salad, and fried chicken (3 good pieces). Two friends and I asked for our ramen to be extra spicy and it came out with a good kick.....loved the rich, flavorful broth and especially how it was NOT salty. Too bad there was only one slice of pork. However, this lunch menu did fill me up pretty well. I prefer my noodles molto al dente (a bit undercooked) but these noodle were okay....as long as it wasn't soggy. So far, based on the flavors I love the ramen here.
There were about 6 tables...possibly 3 of which could sit four. Then about another 10 seats at the bar. Pretty small place and only one waiter...the owner. As everyone noted, the service is rather slow but the food is worth it. We came at noon Friday and total time from being seated to getting the check was about 45 mins...not bad at all. First experience was great....I shall be back to try the rest of the menu.Unpretentious, good ramen, efficient service.  Note that although they have photos of the (empty, I discovered) sake and sochu bottles that line the bar, they do not serve alcohol.An authentic Tokyo-style shoyu ramen tucked away in Center City. Flavorful shoyu broth actually tastes like it was prepared in-house, rather than diluted and prepared as an afterthought. Slightly oily, but a good signifier that it didn't come out of a bottle or a packet. Blowtorched pork belly was terrific, and well worth ordering another slice for $2. Menma was Japanese-style; snappy, with none of the soggy over-soak that one finds in Chinese restaurant-supply menma. Noodles were outsourced, but cooked al dente. Egg was not half-cooked, which was probably the only regrettable point of the bowl.
Atmosphere is also very Japanese style, with a number of counter seats and cash-only. No ticket machines. Owner is Chinese but intent on replicating an authentic Japanese ramen experience. Chef is Laotian, but my compliments to her.  The prices are also really impressively affordable--a really nice surprise.  
Now that they've proven themselves with the shoyu, I'm ready to try their tonkotsu-shoyu next time.Great restaurant. Excellent service and delicious ramen. Will visit again when I'm in town. Didn't get her name unfortunately. We were there for early dinner yesterday around 4:30pm and the waitress was very friendly and attentive. Thank you :)This is a small place with a simple menu that serves ramen for a decent price.  We were the only people in the restaurant during prime lunch hours and got served very quickly.  I got the tonkatsu broth, with extra pork and egg.  The pork was excellent - really fatty the way I like it and the broth was one of the more flavorful and delicious I have tasted.  The portion size was perfect - I was full and satisfied but not exploding by the time I finished. 
Noodle snob boyfriend now rates this a close second to Toki Underground in DC and I agree.  Toki Underground has a funkier atmosphere and more menu items/topping choices.  Other than that the ramens were pretty much equally good.  I think this is better than the other place I have been to in Philadelphia as well.
Great choice for lunch!The menu has changed, I don't really like it, they renamed everything and not correctly. The food still tastes great, and staff are great too. The mayo sauce for the kaarage has way too much garlic. Love the pork ramen!
