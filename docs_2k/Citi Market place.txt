From the second you walk in the door, you're greeted by the adorable woman at the counter. It seems if you come in here more than once a week, she'll know you're name but I haven't been so lucky since my visits are a bit more sporadic.
My most recent discovery are the vegetarian breakfast sandwiches, which are served all day! I particularly enjoy veg. sausage w/ havarti on an everything bagel. I could actually go for one right about now... I've also had the veggie club sandwich and my other half has enjoyed the chicken cheesesteak hoagie and the chicken salad on a croissant. Everything always taste fresh, they are priced really well  (I think my favorite bagel sandwich I mentioned is $2.09-2.99- cheaper than wawa!). The people at the deli are super helpful, offering menus if you can't read the one on the wall and will make great suggestions and accommodations to your needs and want.
Don't forget to grab a really great snack too while you're there- they have amazing chocolate bars, an incredible drink case, tons of chip varieties and those addictive hi-chew candies in every flavor.
I know i'll be back here, who doesn't like fast / delicious / attentive service?I go here all the time for a quick bite to eat in the city. The food is fresh and there's a big variety. They offer good coffee, sandwiches, breakfast and even have a little grocery store with produce and frozen foods and much more. Super convenient and the staff is always very pleasant with a good sense of humor. They even offer a sandwich happy hour during the week. There is seating available as wellI pass Citi Market almost every evening and stop in every week or so for a made to order wrap. I like both the veggie and non-veggie options, both tasty and reasonably priced. I don't buy many groceries here, but I usually pick up a few things that I need. The staff has always been friendly, which is another reason I like giving them my money.This place has lots of great vegan options! I stopped by and got a vegan chicken salad wrap and it was really great. They have many, many vegan selections and it's a great place just to pop in for lunch or takeout dinner!I am almost 30 years old and I just had my first chicken Caesar wrap thanks to the wonderful existence of Citi Market. 
I've been veggie (not vegan) for a long time, and don't get me wrong, I love a good salad or vegetable hoagie as much as the next kid, but one thing that I miss is having the freedom to walk into a deli and have more than one or two lunch options - and choosing between different dressings or cheese doesn't count. Philly is absolutely looking out for "my kind," and I appreciate the inclusion of a 'shroom/tofu/bean burger/wrap/sandwich in more and more places, but I have yet to find a legit, casual, affordable, walk-in/walk-out place that has as awesome a vegetarian and vegan menu as Citi Market.
As soon as you enter this oasis, a blackboard greets you with a bunch of amazing veggie wrap and sandwich options - chicken (or, I guess "chicken" is more appropriate) Caesar, BBQ chicken, I think there was even a meatball sub. Then, to further boggle your tastebuds, there's a whole additional menu above the counter with tons more veg friendly delights. The magic continues in the back of the market, where there are cases and cases of super unique beverages and healthy snacks that are the same as what you would find in Whole Foods, but way easier on the wallet. I was able to snag a wrap and some coconut-water-mixed-with-unicorn-tears drink for about $8. Yay!
To top all of this magic off, the employees who work at Citi Market are incredibly friendly and managed to spell my name right on the first try.Very nice place to grab lunch at work.
Sandwiches are good and with vegetarian and vegan offerings.
One thing I miss is SYLVIA!!!! Where are you Sylvia???As far as neighborhood 'bodegas' go, Citi Market is as good as it gets. Clean, open, and airy, they have an ideal selection of everyday basics, fresh produce, and healthy (and not so healthy) snacks, with a focus on the organic. 
Amazing vegetarian/vegan options, including tofutti for bagels (halle-freakin'-lujah), and pre-packaged Singapore noodles that I crave on a biweekly basis. 
Citi Market has saved the day (or dinner) on many occasions, when I am just too exhausted or busy to cook. It's a bit pricey, but the convenience is worth it.When this place opened last fall, I was really psyched about it, it being right around the corner from Uarts. I quickly became addicted.  I wanted to stay true to Jean's, but I couldn't stop myself because of the  huge variety of vegetarian/vegan options. Also the organic and Asian items in the back of the store I often splurge on.
The veggie chicken hoagie is my usual, but sometimes I switch it up and get the veggie grilled chicken fajitas, or the 'create-your-own- panini thing, which has a so many choices. 
I also love Sylvia the morning/afternoon woman at the register. She is always very sweet.This place is insanely GREAT. The sandwiches are fresh, the menu is vast. If you're looking for an excellent sandwhich and don't have a lot of time, this is the place for you! The staff is amazing and attentive. They remember their customers/lunch orders after a while. I can't say enough about my experiences at Citi Market.My boyfriend's favorite place in Philly! Provide a lot of vegetarian/vegan options, which is why we like it so much. It's set up is like a deli/minimart mixed with a casual local coffee shop.. not so cozy that you would go out of your way to eat there, but if you'd rather munch on-site than take your sandwich to-go it's pleasant enough.  My only reason to take away a star is because they stopped stocking snapea crisps. Petty, I know. But they are my vice!!I work across the street from this place, so part of what I love is the convenience.
From the outside, it doesn't look like much. But inside, the store is MUCH larger than you'd think, and filled with all kinds of things.
As you walk in, there are a bunch of little tables with a view of the street. It's great for meeting a friend for quick coffee or working day lunch.
There's an extensive, veggie-friendly deli that makes food to order, at reasonable prices. Gluten free and vegan cookies! They have fresh produce, frozen meals, yogurts, TONS of drinks, and a regularly changing rotation of new things that you can try out. There are general groceries, too, but like any other mini mart, they're more than if you'd gone to, say, Superfresh.
The best part of this place is the service. The friendly lady behind the counter is awesome, and the people who make your sandwiches are always so nice.A nice surprice on Walnut Street - a deli with some healthier choices, like fresh cut veggies (carrot, celery, cucumber, green and yellow bell peppers and a few grape tomatoes) with dip for $3.19.
Sandwiches, coffee and grocery items, too.I give this place infinite stars. In my brain, because I can only really give it five. FIVE STARS!
I went to Citi Marketplace for the first time today, after walking by many times, as I work several blocks away and frequently pass by on my way to Maoz, kicking myself for forgetting to try it. Today, I remembered. 
Why Citi Marketplace rules.
1. It's inexpensive and it's 2009, we're in a recession, people! And you get what you pay for, as far as size, taste, and quality are concerned.
2. It's the only place I know of in town that makes veggie cheeseteaks and chicken steaks other than Gianna's. 
3. And here, I have the pleasure of talking to the happy, friendly group of people working behind the counter, instead of the lone, angry looking hipster at Gianna's. And Citi has air-conditioning.
4. Beyond the counter there's an excellent selection of grocery items. I didn't even get to venture beyond the front third of the aisles, but next time (before the week is through) I will definitely explore. I saw Salt & Pepper chips and this filled me with glee.
5. MAGAZINES! A great selection. 
6. Their menu is extensive, beyond vegetarian options. Salads, breakfast options, etc. Yes!
And since I can't think of a better way to spend my lunch break than eating a reasonably-priced veggie club and reading magazines in a comfortable, welcoming, air-conditioned shop, Citi takes the cake.Stumbled upon this great place round the corner from where I live. It's clean, spacious enough, has a good enough variety of food for your basic shopping and the employees are really friendly. I go here every few days to stock up on the basics. I went to the grocery store next door to Citi market (I forget its name) and I actually found a mouse in the bread aisle. No joke. So if you're ever on that street and in need of a sandwich/coffee/basic groceries, be sure to go into Citi...I have eaten lunch here virtually every single day since it opened. Its interior is very pleasant, compared with the VIP Market next door, which feels like a cave. It has a great variety of foods for lunch, from sandwiches and wraps to salads and soups. They have a lot of vegetarian options (the veggie chicken wraps are delicious as is the California salad). They have great organic products and plenty of healthy snack items, in addition to convenience basics such as milk and coffee filters. The staff is great. They are very friendly and will remember your name. There is a small seating area for dine-in and a great magazine selection.Let it be known that this is one of my favorite delicatessens in the city!  I actually walked into this store by accident when I first moved here, but it's probably the best mistake I've ever made.
The menu here is fairly extensive and features everything from breakfast to dinner.  They also have a lot of vegan/vegetarian options, which is wonderful.  Their ingredients are incredibly fresh and I have yet to get a bad sandwich here.  They use only Boar's Head lunchmeat here and you can really tell the difference.  Their sandwiches are slightly expensive, but they really give you a nice portion, so it's worth it.  
The front has a coffee counter, the deli, and plenty of tables/chair.  Towards the back, you'll find a well-stocked grocery store and a huge selection of beverages.  They also have cases full of fruits, veggies, and cheeses.  Because this is an Asian market, you can find a variety of Asian ingredients and products here.  The staff is incredibly friendly and the guys behind the deli counter can pound out your order in no time.  
This is definitely a go-to spot for me when I want a quick meal, especially after a long day at work when I'm too tired to make myself something.  So happy I stumbled upon this place.This place is awesome for vegetarian and healthy options. I'm a big fan of the "Natural Power-Fu" brand of sandwiches/tofu salads they bring in. They also have a good selection of frozen foods and ethnic sauces/flavorings and a sandwich bar with tasty veggie and tofu options. Prices are what you'd expect from a bodega as compared to a megastore (which is to say, a little on the high side). 
Their "no credit cards under $5" policy irks me, but the people who work here are super friendly and helpful, so I'll just suck it up and throw in an extra granola bar to get over the hump rather than gripe about it.THis place is a hidden gem, I've walked past many times and never stopped in today I had lunch there it hit the spot, I will keep it in mind for a quick easy lunch. The wrap I had today was pretty standard, I look forward to trying some of the other items. They have a full deli, a case full of fruits and fruit salads, every imaginable bottled beverage you could imagine and many grocery items!  :o)A new deli on Walnut Street, that offers a wide choice of grocery, organics, produces... The staff is friendly, the atmosphere cleaner and warmer than most delis and the prices a little higher... but overall, it's a good option for lunch and their "Buffalo Style Grilled Chicken Wrap" is delicious, I just wish they would put a little more Nachos with it.The staff are truly the reason Citi Marketplace gets 5 Stars!  If it weren't for Sylvia and Olivia I wouldn't go nearly as often (and it's directly across the street!).  They are the perfect place for a quick bite, fresh sandwich, salad, or homemade soup (but only in fall/winter).  Their prices are reasonable and everything is always very consistent.  The interior is well kept and bright and Mark Summers has been known to frequent there so you know it's clean! ;)Five stars for cheap but good. No, they don't have 5-star restaurant quality food, but you're not likely to find a place with cheaper food that's as well prepared. Loved the breakfast sandwich combo with a small coffee for $2.99. That's less than a grande iced coffee at Starbucks.A little more expensive than other places, but much higher quality. The staff is always friendly and the sandwiches are delicious.I used to love this place until they served me a veggie club with totally uncooked, cold veggie bacon.  I thought it was a mistake but when I took it back, the manager argued with me, saying that the bacon was cooked, on "the panini".  I know my Morningstar Farms veggie bacon, which he acknowledged this was, and there is no way to heat that to an internal temperature of 165 degrees, as per instructions, and have it look exactly as it looked when it came out of the freezer.  The manager also told me it could be eaten raw.  Good advice for a manager of a food establishment to give to customers?  I understand it's not meat, but if the product manufacturer says to cook it, I think you ought to cook it.  All he had to do was apologize and give me a new sandwich, but he chose instead to argue with me in front of his other customers.  I prefer not to give money to places that treat their customers like that, and that serve potentially dangerous food intentionally.I'm just baffled at how good their sandwiches are, and consistently so. Their soups are average and their selection is pretty interesting, as far as other food/household goods go...but dear lord, those veggie chicken cheesesteaks -- yes, Virginia, their fake meat and vegetarian options are both plentiful and yummy -- and club sandwiches are a great lunch and large enough to take home for a nice dinner too. 
Also, everybody there is so pleasant!I started going here the day it opened and after moving, I miss it so much! The owners are so friendly and really get to know you on a first-name basis. I was so thrilled with the vegan menu because vegan sandwiches (fake meat kind) aren't that readily made anywhere. It well priced and has great hours.This used to be my "go to" lunch place. I used to go here almost everyday because the food was good and the prices were reasonable.. Salads were the best!  fresh, organic and a really nice portion! Sandwiches were always good too! But it seems to have changed quite a bit. The portions seem to have become smaller too. I went back again after not having been there in a while just because I used to love this place. Got a tuna salad sandwich and soup. They got my soup ready before anyone even started to make the sandwich. Soup sat there cooling off. And when I got back to work to eat in my lunch room, my tuna salad sandwich on white bread with lettuce and tomatoes seemed more like a spread - I mean not much tuna salad on the sandwich and it didn't taste very good. tried to eat it but ended up throwing 1/2 of the sandwich in the trash.
 I haven't been back again since.  This is very disappointing to me becasue I loved this place and have sent so many co-workers here. I'm not likely to go back unless I hear from one of my co workers that things have imporved. Sorry Citi Market place! I hope you guys get it together and get back to the way things used to be. 
.Spacious, clean, good coffee selection, good customer service, nice menu, good selection of foods and other items.Come here for lunch from time to time. Always get a great panini. You get to pick what you want meat, cheese, fixings, roll/bread. All for a reasonable price and a pretty quick turn around time. Their other sandwiches and salads that I've had have all been winners. There are other deli's closer to where I work, but if I have the time to walk there, I pick Citi Marketplace.
Also has plenty of vegetarian/vegan options.I am only giving them four stars for their vegetarian menu. Everything is great. However, don't go there for a breakfast sandwich, or a regular chicken-salad sandwich - you will be disappointed.Citi Marketplace stands in stark contrast to VIP right down the street.  As opposed to dingy lighting, barebones climate control, and dirty floors as found in VIP, Citi is inviting, warm, constantly clean, and has a wide selection of organic foods and offbeat selections.  
I'd give it four stars, but I do have two minor complaints about it overall.  First, the service is incredibly slow for any sandwiches.  No matter if there's other patrons or not, I'm always waiting up to ten to fifteen minutes for a simple sandwich.  Also, the prices are a bit high, but I suppose you should expect that in a place with such a good, diverse collection of food and produce.
I'd definitely recommend it notwithstanding!Citi Marketplace is one of the few places i will cross broad to eat at on my very short lunch break!
Being a vegetarian in Center City gets kind of boring. Sure I can walk to all the new trendy places and wait in line for 25 minutes for an overpriced flavorless sandwich, but I'd rather not. Instead I walk across broad and buy a delicious fairly priced sandwich.
That being said, the veggie cheesesteak is da' bomb! the combination of seitan, veganese, cheese, lettuce, tomato and ketchup is perfect. I always suggest trying this  on some sort of roll, the wrap tends to fall apart pretty fast.
i'd also suggest the veggie club, although it seems like you can't make a bad choice!It started with the novelty of getting a breakfast sandwich in center city with veggie sausage and has since grown to a borderline obsession with everything Citi Marketplace. They have an amazing array of delicious vegetarian deli sandwiches made to order (try the veggie chicken salad= amazing) not to mention all the side components you could need for a healthy and satisfying meal. I can honestly say that I have loved everything I've ordered here.   But what really sends them soaring over the top is the staff. So unendingly pleasant and sweet, they can honestly turn your day around.. If I could, I would eat here every day.On days when work is going kind of slow and we have the time to walk over to 13th and walnut my coworkers and I reward ourselves with hot personal paninis. They also have EVERY bottled drink imaginable and a great selection of chips. 
Warning! they NEVER give you roasted red peppers when you ask for them. They are always yellow. What's that about? I have no idea. It is something I will never understand because it's not like red peppers are more expensive and it seems unlikely that they would mix up the word yellow and the word red. Perhaps the guy who makes the sandwiches is red/yellow colorblind. It's a mystery. Regardless, avoid the "roasted red peppers", go for the avocado because those are more expensive in real life and it makes any sandwich sick-nasty.Came here for breakfast and ordered a panini sandwich, which I paired with their homemade (I think?) potato salad.
Friendly service, good food, and reasonable price. I will definitely be coming back here.I came here for a breakfast sandwich one morning. My Turkey Bacon, Egg & Cheese was nothing too special I mean literally I can walk into any store and order it. I liked how they let you pick out what kind of bread you would like, So they do have fresh bread. While waiting for my sandwich I walked around and they do have quite a selection & assortment of different drinks & snacks. They also have vegetarian options which is nice.
The place is very clean & well kept. I will probably come here again & maybe order lunch.We decided to go here on a thundering, nasty, Saturday night. To our surprise the corned beef hoagie we ate was amazing. I could tell all the ingredients were pretty fresh. My wife liked everything too.
In addition they sell cool Japenese snacks like mochi and dried snow peas.
Most importantly the corned beef hoagie we ate was only $4.79. Compared to another famous deli in the area which has $15 sandwiches, this was a relief!
Great prices, great food, nice people.My girlfriend and I were looking for someplace to get lunch real quick one day, and I had suggested we walk towards IHOP, since I feel like I never explore the East side of Broad street enough. After getting to IHOP, we noticed the Citi Market and decided to give it a go. After walking into a somewhat seemingly endless store, we ordered sandwiches and got some drinks. What a selection! Everything from Joe Tea to Naked to Orangina, they have a drink that will go well with whatever kind of sandwich, wrap, panini that you order. The italian hoagie I had was awesome, well made and filling too. I would recommend this to anyone looking to switch up the regular Wawa hoagie routine.I love this place! It's just a shame it's so damn expensive...
They have a great array of foreign sweets, which I have a fun time with. They also carry Boar's Head and make a pretty gosh darn good Bagel w/ Lox.
If you have the money, and are looking for a yummy sandwich or fresh fruit salad, then stop by!Never fails to deliver fresh and sweet fruit cups ! Sandwiches are delish and place is very clean.  Ever need a quick grab then don't think twice !Take your typical bodega and now throw a bunch of money at it. This caters to a completely different person than the average sap who goes into your local rundown bodega. The food here isn't cheap, but it also has fairly unique options, it's not your typical sandwich place. Really like it, and I need to go here more often.This place is right around the corner from my job and I'm in there daily. The staff is super friendly, they have tons of gluten free, non-gmo, and vegan snacks and tons of vegetarian options at the deli. Definitely my go-to store when I'm around 13th and Walnut.I had a fresh made-to-order wrap that was ready quickly and tasted great! I'm so happy I stumbled upon this deli. It's reasonably priced and there are so many options. There's also a small convenience store with both gourmet and standard groceries. I'll definitely be back!Good lord, another update?
Every single time I've gone in here, I've been satisfied. Their breakfast sandwiches are great...way better than the street cart fare around the area (free coffee in the morning to boot!)  
Love the service, the food is tasty with just the right amount of spice/care, and their chip selection still rocks. Come here and eat/shop! I don't want to see this place disappear. 
I rarely give out 5's but I cannot find any reason NOT to give it to these guys and gals. Simply outstanding!Fresh bread, and the recommended cooked salami sandwich was sliced thin, piled high and rich and meaty. The corned beef was also quite good. Actually wasn't expecting anything, just a quick meal after an exhausting day before conking out in my hotel room across the street, but was extremely pleasantly surprised when I took my first bite. Philadelphia, if I never see you again, I will always remember you as the city of wonderful sandwiches.I get my breakfast here fairly frequently. But really it's cuz I'm a big fan of their organic mexican dark roast coffee. It's kinda inconsistent, but when it's great one of the best I've had in philly.This is a go to place for my co-workers and I for lunch.  Went today and made my own panini--can't go wrong for $5.99.  Got grilled chicken, cheddar, roasted red peppers, spinach and portabello mushrooms on an amazing multi-grain roll.  It was amazing.  Love the friendly staff there also.  Can't go wrong here!I stumbled upon Citi Marketplace a couple months ago while getting some stuff printed out for work.  I was drawn to their awning, emblazoned with one of the absolute worst typefaces known to man-- Jokerman...ugh.  I've found since then, however, that this is the only thing not to like about Citi Marketplace.  And if you're not a quirky artsy-fartsy pseudo designer like me, you'll find that there is nothing not to like, and that this place is pretty awesome.
FIRST IMPRESSIONS:
This place is very clean, unlike many of the neighboring convenience stores that are more reminiscent of NYC's little foreign-owned corner shops.  Rather, this is like Grocery meets Greenhouse (both are located 2 blocks over on Chestnut), with smart hardwood floors and modern-looking lighting.
THE FOOD/DELI:
I haven't tried lunch here yet, but I get breakfast here a couple times a week, braving the cold and the extra distance walked, for their delectable breakfast sandwiches...the best part is that they let you pick what you want it on-- you want it on a croissant?  Magnifique!  You want it on an everything bagel?  Mazel Tov!  You want it on a piece of focaccia?  Molto bene!  You literally hand it to them and let them know what you want, which I like.  It's ready in a snap, and they have a deal that gives you free coffee or in my case, tea with your sammich.  I've waited for 15 minutes elsewhere, but here, it's ready by the time I'm done browsing their grocery section.
THE GROCERY:
It's surprisingly comprehensive, I wish I had one closer to me, because I'd definitely need to shop at more-expensive Whole Foods less.  They have everything you'd expect from a breakfast/lunch spot (chips, drinks, what have you), but their selection of Asian cooking materials (for those like me who like to use their Wok but often need special ingredients) is very good.  They have a full row of frozen foods, making me think I could get most of my food shopping done here if I needed to.  I like to go there and pick out stuff to make dinner with later that night.  It's clean, easy to navigate, and the price is right around what you'd expect, no more, no less.
THE SERVICE:
How about the adorable young lady who works the register, she is always in a good mood, it lifts my spirits even on the most dismal of mornings.  They have learned my name, they know my "the usual" and they know how keep me coming back.
THE BOTTOM LINE:
This place is brand new, but I already say it's under-appreciated and I hope and predict that they'll see more business and stick around.  Sometimes I go back to the Greenhouse when I'm in the mood for a little sloppier and greasier (still delicious in its own right), but for the most part, this is my new spot and I recommend it to anyone in the area looking for good food, a well-stocked grocery, with a nice atmosphere and attitude to top it off.Absolutely LOVE this place- i would give this place 10 stars if I could. I love how they make fresh food (breakfast,lunch, and dinner ) and with tons of vegan options. Even the "fake meat" is so good, I couldnt tell the difference. 
Its a good place to eat with friends, pick up food, drink coffee, study, etc. Its also clean inside and the staff is very friendly.God how I love this place. It has all of my favorite things... hoagies, Dirty Chips, & other food goods that are hard to find elsewhere. I always always get either a turkey wrap/hoagie with pepper jack cheese, LTO, and spicy & honey mustards. Delicious! Top it off with a bag of jalapeno Dirty chips & I am good to go. The staff is always always super nice as well. Sure to get a smile out of you when you're not having the brightest of days.Great selection of goodies not typically available at the Wawa's or 7-11, but on the pricey side as convenience markets go. I went for a grilled chicken wrap with buffalo sauce which was good but not extraordinary.
I'm just glad to see more and more establishments carrying Boar's Head. It's 10 times better than Dietz and Watson.I always get excited to go here. They have a huge vegetarian selection at their deli with many sauces and breads to choose from. Prices are great. They also carry a wide assortment of groceries. Plus+they are always nice:)Anyone know why they closed, or what the deal is?
Also, need to add more words because Yelp. So here you go:

It's a great spot.Mm mm! I love checking out vegan restaurants in the areas where I'm visiting. It really sucks to find myself in a vegan food desert (okay, that's exaggerating a bit as grocery store do stock raw ingredients, but if you don't have time to cook...).
My friend and I got milkshakes. They were awesome! Being in Philadelphia, I was really hoping to get a Philly cheese steak sandwich, but they don't seem to offer anything cheesy. This is the only reason I couldn't give five stars. Service was awesome, the people were nice, and I was really tempted to try another item on the menu. :)Regularly disappointing me on the breakfast sandwich front. Not sure why I don't just get an egg sandwich from a cart each time I foolishly walk in here.so glad i decided to drop in here. there is limited seating. the food options are vast. want a pita? done. want a wrap? done. you can have spinach, sundried tomato, whole wheat... the list goes on.
i noticed 3 soup options and they have several flavors of odwalla and naked juice. grab some chips and you're good to goooo!This place is the gold standard of Philly bodegas. I can't believe that I avoided it for as long as I did, walking past and turning my nose up at what I assumed was "just another overpriced Philly corner store". I finally walked under its blue canopy mere months ago, inspired by a raging hangover that needed to be fed and upon recommendation of my husband who touted Citi Marketplace's seitan cheesesteak as one of the best in town. If you've ever seen The Simpson's episode about Homer and the rotten hoagie that he kept on eating regardless of the gastric terror that it caused him, tenderly proclaiming to his beloved sandwich, "Sandwich, I could never stay mad at you," that's EXACTLY how I felt about that seitan hoagie. The only difference is that it was too delicious to save for later, and I had no problem finishing it in one sitting. I've been hooked on Citi Marketplace ever since. Their variety of vegetarian sandwich options isn't matched by any other shop in Philly, and they carry a variety of other regular faves like Szechuan noodles, Morningstar products, and Kombucha tea. Their produce section is equally impressive. Just last Saturday, I purchased an apple that was nearly the size of my head. As with all bodegas some of the products are overpriced, whereas others are a steal. Citi Marketplace will remain a regular breakfast and lunch stop on my almost-daily walks from 11th to 17th Street.I work right by here and have been trying to eat way less meat. They have awesome options that are do delicious. I order the black bean burger with avocado and cheese as a wrap I read of a traditional burger. It is sooooo good. The folks who work there are nice and friendly. They have some gluten free cookie options too. The only reason I would give one less star is am is because they aren't always stocked on the market side.  Some stuff will go un-replenished for a bit. But that doesn't take away from how good the sandwiches are. They have plenty of traditional meat options as well.Very convenient, as it is right next to one of our school buildings. The sandwiches are always pretty good, but what is amazing is the soups. I believe they are homemade, or at least they taste like it. I got minestrone one time, which was delicious and recently I tried the beef barley. I would not ordinarily choose beef barley, but I gave it a shot, and WOW, it was soo good. I think i will try all of their soups!Fresh, hot soup every day.  Alternative flours.  I am in love with this place and thank the powers that be that it's in my neighborhood!Cheap sandwiches with good topping choices. You can pick the bread (tons of bakery options) you'd like it served on, which is very cool unless you come at night and it's all kind of stale and picked over. Looked like a decent grocery also. 
If what you're after is a low priced, decent sandwich it's a good spot to check out.This place is amazing.  The staff is super nice and friendly.  The sandwiches are delicious, and they have the best selection of vegetarian sandwiches in the city.  I also love their selection of grocery items.  The grocery item are a little pricey, but great in a pinch.This place just opened in October and is one of the many "long aisled" mini-grocery stores scattered throughout center city. There's a lot of room in the front with some tables near the walls and windows for patrons to enjoy their coffee/sandwiches/soup (they were still waiting for the equipment the last I checked). 
Keep walking toward the back, past the glass display of meat/cheese and basket of bread, and you'll come across a small refrigerator of vegetables and assorted fruits. Fairly standard fare, nothing too exciting. I do think they have a fairly generous yogurt selection considering it's a mini-grocery. 
The rest of the store was so-so. It's not "Asian themed" so if you were disappointed by the selection at VIP Food & Market next door, this just might fill the gap. You'll find more chips here!
I've yet to try their prepared food or coffee, but will get around to it soon. The one bonus point this place gets is in its cleanliness and roominess. Granted, it is new, but it's nice to walk into a store and not have drab fluorescent lights all over the place. 
Similar in my review of its neighbor, I'd give this place three and a half stars, but round down as the selection of items isn't to my liking. Still, if you're in the area and don't feel like trekking far for something to munch on, definitely drop by.I live up the street from Citi Marketplace.  I have breakfast & lunch here often.  I love it all.  Its a great small grocery store, coffee bar, and sandwich place.  The sandwiches are all excellent with high quality ingredients.  My favorite being a panini on a brioche roll.  Soooo good.  Also great subs.  Not sure why other reviewers find it pricey.  Just this evening our family of 4 ordered  3 drinks, big bag of chips, med. size bag of chips,  2-12" hoagies, a panini,  turkey club, and a 1/2 lb. of pasta salad for $26.00.  The employees are wonderful.  They are very friendly and will basically make you whatever you want.  I feel so comfortable here.i walked in here this morning and the whole placed smelled of bacon. mmm bacon. they had everything i needed this morning which happened to be cup o soup, orange juice, low cal microwave popcorn (newman's own!), and a gossip mag (big selection)
they also have produce (more than the corner store near my apartment, gourmet cheeses, specialty items like sesame oil, and morningstar products like chik nuggets!
best part: only a $5 minimum to use your credit card (there is also an atm on site)
my vote: better than your av-er-age corner grocery!If I could give this place a billion stars I would.
My job changed locations recently and now Citi is right around the corner. I go there almost every time I work (despite the relatively large amount of places to eat in the area) because it's just so damn good I can't stop going back.
I've been trying to be as vegetarian as possible lately (whatever that means) and this place kills it for vegans and vegetarians. Vegannaise and soy cheese are always available. I love their egg white, soy cheese, and tofu (+ avocado for me!) sandwich so much  that I tried to recreate it at home plenty of times, but I just don't have the sandwich-making magic that Citi has.
The workers are the sweetest, coolest people to interact with during your lunch break. If the cashier Sylvia doesn't bring a smile to your face you just might be the devil.  In the 50+ times I've gone there, they only got my order wrong once, and it was just that they forgot soy cheese - which didn't really detract much from the flavor of the sandwich anyway.
To top it off, they gave me a Christmas card with a coupon for one free sandwich last week! If I was infinitely rich, I'd hire these people as personal chefs.Citi is nicer than the market next door, VIP.  Cleaner, wider aisles, better selection, good sandwiches, and friendly staff.  I haven't shopped at either store enough to know which one is cheaper but if the prices are similar, this one is the clear winner.amazing. I work near by and go here all the time for lunch. Every thing I have had is amazing. today I tried the chipolte chicken wrap - unreal. My other standby there is pastrami on rye with siracha sauce.  They are the only place I know of with Mama Zuma's revenge Habanero chips which is a huuuge plus!The place was a decent size considering looking at the outside. The store is really cute actually, but they have basically the same prices as any other store selling fancy organic things. I had the cheesesteak. It wasn't greecey at all, which was a nice change of pace. The cheese was slightly spicy that they used...just as heads up if your sensitive to spice. But it was very yummy! :)i love citi! first of all, everyone here is super nice. the counter-lady is always upbeat, singing along to B101.1, it's great to even step foot into this joint.
second of all, bacon egg and cheeses are GOOD! not greasy and not skimpy all on a fresh bagel and you get a free cup of coffee to boot.
lastly, nice grocery selection. fresh meat, dairy and other sundries. 
all in all, a really great place.have i never reviewed citi marketplace? hmph
i'm a regular here. regular as in i stop in 3-5 times a week. i've probably conducted 500 transactions in this store. 9 times out of ten, i'm here to buy some kind of vegan cookie or sugary protein bar which they have an excellent selection of.
pros & cons compared to similar area stores (VIP, 7/11, etc.)
pros:
- great selection, esp. of the treats i like (lenny & larry cookies, clif builder bars)
- seating area with optional magazine selection
- coffee is actually not terrible, and is discounted after 3pm (I believe.)
cons:
- slightly more expensive than other area bodegas including VIP & 7/11
- maybe it's a cultural/language barrier thing, but staff seems generally uninterested in answering questions.
- sitting in the cafe is nearly intolerable for two reasons 1) the Q102 radio station is always on. i swear to god, the same 5 worst songs play over and over. it's like groundhog's day sitting in there.  2) door chimes and announces "hello" over and over even if no one's at the door.
conclusion:
i will likely still continue to come here and patronize the store so long as i am financially able to do so, as long as they continue to stock delicious vegan treats.OK, picture your typical neighborhood corner store. Now make it ten times cleaner (or maybe eight times - I live in a neighborhood that gives me low expectations). now picture that it has tons of vegetarian options, a nice staff and doesn't charge you out the bunghole. Welcome to Citi Marketplace.
A friend and I stopped in for cigarettes and maybe a soda. We were blown away. This place has a great selection of stuff you don't usually find in crummy corner store - like Amy's, Silk and (oh my goodness) aisles you can actually walk down without turning sideways.
I'm not about to do all my shopping at a convenience store in Center City, but whenever I'm in the area and need to stop somewhere that's not sketchy and won't charge me more than I'm willing to pay, Citi Marketplace is the place to go.Citi Marketplace kicks the rear of VIP next door. ...That would make a great headline, but it's only the truth. In terms of freshness, variety, obscurities - win win win. Their produce (although limited) is good quality but a tad expensive. The selection of vegetarian joys is limitless. There are items there that I have never even seen anywhere else in the city. They carry Soya Kaas in the blocks (which has become impossible to find) as well as an organic version of everything and anything.
Of course, you WILL pay more for these things - although curiously, some items are actually cheaper there. Go figure. 
           Even the coffee is good...and inexpensive. 
One thing I don't get is the magazine rack - I've never seen anyone actually BUY anything from the rack, only snag it to read while eating and put it back. Faux Pas! 
         The girl who usually works during the day is adorable and is singing constantly to all the songs on B101. With her little Asian accent, AND knowing that she only memorized all the words to every Billy joel song from working every day and hearing the same 75 song loop over and over, makes me want to sit longer and enjoy her free concerts. 
         Sandwiches? Again, vegetarian's paradise. Veggie sausage, bacon, burgers...on Metropolitan Bakery bread (which they also sell there) is just another notch on Citi's bedpost. 
        Last advantage: $5 debit minimum. Fantastic.
I withheld that last star because of the high prices on most of the grocery items. But it's nice to know they are there in a pinch. The addition of this place has added quality to my daily existence, and I will sit listening to that lovely girl with my chin in my hands when I am done with my lunch ANY day.Such delicious treats!! You can find imported goods from all over the world at reasonable prices. Their deli quality is amazing. Great vibe, better service. Wish we had this is Chicago!This is a fabulous market.  It has a lot of vegetarian options including faux chicken and cheesesteaks, so it is a nice place for lunch in center city. It also have meat and dairy options for those who choose to eat animal products.  The Market also has a wide array of pantry items, so you can do some grocery shopping while waiting for your sandwich to be made.  The staff is amazing and helpful, the location is right in the heart of the city and the place is clean and well organized.  It doesn't get any better than this.I love citi market place. Not the best spellers but oh well. I come here on my lunchbreak often during the afternoon. And they are busy because I'm not the only one who is in love. They remember my name and they remember what I order. How diligent. I try not to get the same thing all the time but I am a creature of habit. I recommend two things. The grilled chicken panini, with Swiss cheese, onion, roster peppers, and portobella, aaaand basil pesto! And the second thing is a Reuben sandwich with everything on it. I like to get coffee and read and people watch. See you there soon. Hope you like B101.1.This place is incredibly clean, the food is consistently good, and the staff are very friendly. It's one of the few places you can find Mochi (the little Japanese rice cakes), and they have a wide variety of specialty and organic foods. The staff knows me and my coworkers by name, and they remember the various things we all order. I've had their hoagies, which are decent, their wraps which are also good, but the one thing that stands out is the veggie sausage egg and cheese... It's absolutely amazing. I'm not a vegetarian, but I absolutely love this sandwich. 
Another great thing is you can buy day old hoagie rolls there... 2.50 for 6 long rolls plus whatever else they throw in the bag. At a day old hoagie rolls are still just fine, and I always keep a stash of them in my freezer.The Veggie Club will make you want to be a better (wo)man. It's just that good. Also, the humour-filled service is always a welcomed respite.Some time ago, I stopped in for picnic fixings and learned that their apple bran muffins are delicious. Today, I decided to try Citi Marketplace for more in-depth shopping, taking the time to explore their aisles. I was amazed to see how much variety they have, from quinoa (I previously had only found quinoa at the Trader Joe's!) to Asian sauces/spices to seltzer water to the widest variety of Greek yogurt I've seen in a store (including large chains). Very impressed.This place deserves five stars simply for filling the shoes of an ever increasing demand for cheap food that EVERYONE can eat. 
Here's why Citi rocks: 
1) They have 2 kinds of gluten free bread, veganise, and a variety of vegan cheeses on hand. 
2) They have a long biblical sized plaque (think ten commandments) detailing all of their vegetarian options. 
3) They serve food for any time of day, and really nail it at breakfast. 
4) You often get free coffee with your sandwich. 
5) The staff are very nice and will happily assist you in building your own sandwich. 
6) Unlike other delis there is ample space for sitting down to enjoy your food. 
7) Did I mention it was cheap? 
So yeah, it's really nice to have a normal, almost traditional, breakfast experience where I can eat food without having to pull out a bull horn and tell the world that I'm a gluten free vegan. As much as I love vegan joints, it's really nice to eat somewhere that reminds me of my pre-vegan/gluten free days. And you know, a place that's cheap. That's also nice.
