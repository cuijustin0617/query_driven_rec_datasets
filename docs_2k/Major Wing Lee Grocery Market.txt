This place has been around for a while and their prices are reasonable. expect to wait during peak times (lunch, dinner) best thing to do is call ahead.  They have a huge local following. Hoagies and sandwiches are great.  Being as though the food can be bought with public assistance cards it tends to be low income heaven which can also increase wait times because some chick is trying to feed the whole house with hoagies and !@#$% like thats is the most  irritating thing about Majors they have only one person ringing you up even during peak times. oh yeah did i mention the mexican guy that builds the sandwiches but hardly understand wtf your saying at times or at least he acts like he doesn'tGREAT one stop shop. The hoagies are deliciously fresh and very inexpensive without lacking quality. I will say they are a little stingy with the hoagie toppings but like I've said very inexpensive and tasty food.I've been thinking about writing this review for quite a while. The reason I've been putting it off has been the inconsistency of my experience at this market. In the past 6 months, I may have bought 5 hoagies for lunch here. The quality of each has ranged from inedible to lately two of the best italian hoagies I have ever had. Coincidentally, the last 2 hoagies I purchased during our last 2 snowstorms and the shop wasn't busy. On a normal day the line to order may be 20 people deep at times. So rather than tempt fate I will continue to make this my go to choice during blizzards and limit my culinary range to the italian hoagie.havent tried the food, saw this on parking wars, People are willing to spend $3 for a sandwich and risk a $41 ticket, that sandwich has got to be good!BBQ Chicken or Nigerian Hoagie - Extra mayo, cheese, lettuce/tomatoes, sweet peppers, salt/pepper/oregano....for only $3?? 
Any place where I can get a fresh tasting hoagie, chips, drink, and a sandwich baggie filled with my candy of choice all for about $5 is A-OK with me!
The lady slicing the meat soooo reminds me of the famed "Soup Nazi"-  so, for the love of all that's good, PLEEZ know what you want to order before you reach that back counter!! Great drink selection, too! Who wouldn't love this place?!?The best Italian hoagie in Philly.
Fresh made, big and cheap.
4.75 for a large one
2.75 for a smallThis is the best place to get hoagies made fresh while you wait. They have been there for a long Time and kudos to them. Keep up the good service.
John HThis corner grocery and deli across from Johnny Manana's is the cheapest but best hoagie you will find.   They make it to order right in front of you.  You might have to wait as the place is tiny and the word is out in the Falls!Great Hoagies here. I like the fact that they are fast, cheap, and fresh. I think the freshness comes from the fact that they are so busy so the meat doesn't even have a chance to sit. Good luck with finding parking, it's best to come with someone else and have one person stay with the car and the other person hop out and order.went there today and had to laugh because like one reviewer says on here the lady slicing the meat never does look at you.I had a small meatball sandwich fritos and a can of diet soda for just 4.75 The meatballs were from a box and not homemade the sauce was on the sweet side which I like and the roll was decent but boring.I would go back here if I was on a tight budget and needed more bang for my buck but I wouldnt go outta my way for itThis just a update of previous review. Havent been here in a long time. Prices have went up again unfortunately. Just sign of the times everything is going up. Still pretty decently priced. Everything still was great although the roll this time didnt seem as fresh as usual. I still give it a thumbs up. As always one word of caution. The parking here is almost non-existent its hard to find a spot. Low lives parking authority is always on the prowl here. They know about this spot and they know people are going to run in for a minute to pick up there sandwiches.saw it on parking wars. imma hoagie junkie n had to try it. im in philly all the time. went last nite w the hb ,he lived in philly all his life.. one of the top 5 hoagies i ever had. had the italian, he had the honey turkey, fresh meat n cheese on a good roll with just the right amount of toppings and seasoning. mmm yummy.n im not even saying anything about the prices. i paid almost twice as much for my hoagie fix last week in bala cynwyd and it wasnt nearly as good.  definetly will b my spot for my hoagie fix from now on oh n we hadda park up the hill on midvale and walk downGreat hoagies. Had a huge honey turkey, prov, Mayo, lettuce, onion, and tomato hoagie for barely over 5 bucks. Very tasty and cheap. Set up is mostly a small convenience store with the sandwich making in the back. You'll see the line and for good reason.Oh good ol Majors. I can agree with some of the other reviews about the deli staff. They've never messed up my order per se, but I was a bit concerned when the lady who took my order didn't read me back what I said to make sure it was correct, but it was correct so, no harm there. I think it's a cultural difference, or simply this place is obviously not trying to win you over with aesthetics, decor and friendliness. You order your food, you wait for it, you pay and you leave. It's a corner store not a Primos. And with that, I am satisfied.The best! Hoagies and sandwiches are always on point. Also, one of the few places you can still get a full lunch for under $5. If you have a minute stop In, you won't regret it.Its an okay hoagie. Not great, not bad just okay. The secret to a good hoagie.... Is the roll! The roll is perfect, the meat was good quality but the cheese was suspect. And she got a lil heavy handed with the crushed red pepper flakes. Also, I'm NOT a fan of swatting away flies as I order my food. They might wanna invest in a flytrap. 
The prices are more than reasonable, but I'm a WOL girl so Pagano's is still my spot for hoagies...lolHad a chicken salad hoagie and their potato salad on the side. Seriously some of the greatest potato salad I have ever had. Their service was also very quick, I only had to wait in a short line to place my order and wait. The prices were very reasonable too!By far Major's is as good as it gets for great hoagies. Also if you are in need of platters for a party or event, you cannot beat the prices!Great hidden gem for deli sandwiches and a w hot sandwiches.  This is my favorite place for meatball sandwiches. And their prices are very fair.  Mostly only locals go here but it is always busy.Ok, this place has delicious hoagies! I'd been hearing about it for a while, as it's around the corner from my hair salon, but I'd never had a chance to stop in. I stopped in today at lunchtime and ordered a barbecue chicken hoagie....SO GOOD! I actually let it sit in the fridge for like an hour once I got it home, and when I unwrapped it the bread wasn't soggy at all (you know how they can get sometimes). Also, the prices are great! I ordered a large hoagie and I bought two small bags of chips to share with my friend and it all came to a grand total of  $6! You can't beat that! I'll definitely stop into MWL again.Good, decent, and inexpensive hoagies from an essentially non-descript corner grocer. Their hoagies are definitely easy on the budget.
The people who park to close to the corner of Ridge and Midvale are in the store getting the hoagies.Went there with a friend to grab a late lunch. Per all the reviews we figured we couldn't go wrong. The hoagies were not that great. We bought extras for our family and no one was impressed. I wouldn't go back.This is a nondescript basic corner store. They have a side business sort of speak of selling sandwiches. No fancy smancy stuff just your ordinary sandwiches an meatball. The selling point is the price. You get a great Hoagie for 3.75 it was 3.25 just a year ago but with gas prices an all sure they had to go up. For this price you expect budget lunch meat or just a few slices of meat. Nope they pack on the meat they use Dietz an Watson, Carolina Pride, Jennie-O an other name brand lunch meat. They cut it right in front of your an they also use fresh Amoraso Bread. Im pretty picky about food an i can give my thumbs up. I pass through this place an by looks you would think Nah a sandwich from that place. I use to work on City Line an my co-workers put me down on this place. A few words parking is limited super tight an this place is almost always packed even if you go at night.  The A-holes parking authority is usually breathing down your neck especially during business hours so be on the watch.A friend mine moved up the street from Major's recently and we went there to grab something to eat one day for lunch. The people there were nice and fast and the food was great. Much better than we expected. We'll definitely be returning!The best honey turkey hoagie for the price too bad there is no where to park. The rolls are fresh and the turkey is delicious.Corner convenience store located in east falls. They have everything you would expect in a corner store plus a great place to get a good, cheap hoagie. Staff is friendly.Very affordable and fresh hogies. Convenient for those of us that live in the neighborhood. And they've been around for years.The hoagies are not what it's cracked up to be. If you have never had a Primos hoagie or a hoagie from Giant market then I could see why you think this place has the best hoagies. They do but have the best hoagies and I don't understand why people think they do. Not only that but the workers in the store are not very welcoming. They give attitude and they are very rude. They always allow neighborhood people to sit at the front of the store making less room for customers to navigate. They have a guy that works in the store by the name of Jimmy. Jimmy appears to have some sort of disability and they appear to talk down on him.  I repeat, these are the most unfriendly group of Asians that I gave ever met. My friend used to always visit this store but she stopped going there because of the nasty attitudes they gave.Much better and cheaper than Wawa for a good hoagie, and they take orders over the phone so you can avoid the line.  This has become my office's go to lunch place.Still the best place to get a great hoagie for a great price. I live about a 15 min drive from this place an i dont like driving but will take the drive to get their hoagies. The place is often packed if you go between 11-2 an between 5-7. Even on the off hours this place may or may not be packed its the luck of the draw. Today i got lucky no one in front of me however as i ordered my hoagies 5 people came in right behind me. The only caveat is the parking. It is smack in the corner across from a fire station an a few local hotspot bars on a busy street. I went to a deli that i never been to on a trip to shore with a few friends. The hoagie there was bland roll was hard an at $ 6 bucks. The next day i bought Major hoagies an everyone was shocked especially when i said it was only 3.75. What i like about this place if i say Light Mayo its light mayo other places you order your hoagie with light Mayo an still smack a bunch on. . I had about 30 hoagies from this place in the past 4 years an never had a bad one. One word do not attempt to park illegally. The A-Holes parking authority frequently prowl this area like a lion prowls a wounded Antelope.Simple, excellent, excellent, cheap hoagies.  Call ahead the line can be pretty long for lunch or dinner.Major W. Lee is the best sandwich place you'll ever try! You won't be disappointed, just be careful where you park! The PPA is brutal!Best cheap hoagies around. 
as long as...
...you order quickly when barked at by the woman slicing who will never look at you.
...you dont mind not getting premium meats
...you dont mind standing in line for about 5-10 min.
...you didn't illegally park
...you have cash.
but really. so cheap. yet really good.Great hidden gem for hoagies and a couple hot sandwiches.  This is my favorite place for meatball sandwiches. And their prices are very fair.  Mostly only locals go here but it is always busy.Oh My! This place has awesome hoagies. I work in Bala Cynwyd and this is just a quick hop away. the other day I ordered lunch for 4 people for $20! That included hoagies, chips, and cans of soda. It's now known in my office as "The Hoagie Spot." Someone is ALWAYS going on a Friday and you definitely get bang for your buck here. How can you beat a $2.50 hoagie?! It's so fresh and delicious! Don't be scared of the corner store tuna hoagie, it's actually really good!
Parking is a beast around lunch time but the food is oh so worth it.Cheap for a hoagie, however the Italian is primarily bologna... Decent if you are in a pinchMajor's, or Wing Lee's as oldheads call it,  has hands-down the cheapest, most delicious, freshest hoagies in the city (as the line stretching out the door and around the corner every day at lunch and dinner times demonstrates). 
Every other review here says basically the same thing, but it's been a while since anyone said anything and I think it's important to know things haven't changed (though hoagie prices have gone up about 50 cents).
My favorites: honey turkey, honey ham, chicken salad, meatballs (the only hot sandwich they offer, but delicioso). I also love that when you get to be a regular call-in, all but one of the staff start to recognize your voice (or order) and you hardly ever have to give your name!
My advice: call about 20 minutes ahead, but give yourself more time if it's between 12-2 or 4:30-6:30. If you have to drive, the other reviewers got it right-- be prepared to risk a ticket as you squeeze in near the corner of Ridge and Midvale and pray that your reward is all ready and awaiting your greedy little hands on top of the deli counter. Also be prepared to fight your way to the counter during rush hours-- it's tiny and I guarantee it'll be *packed.*
****EDIT 1/9/12 - I just saw an episode of Parking Wars where the meterman talked about how he just sets up on the corner and tickets every single car that tries to squeeze in for their sandwiches. he said something like-- "they must put gold flakes in those hoagies-- that lady just paid $43.50 for a chicken salad hoagie! and thinks it's worth it!" So, apparently, even the Parking Authority loves Wing Lee's! *****Good hoagie.  Fresh hoagie.  Cheap hoagie.  Yay!   Don't park illegally or the Parking Authority will make it a pretty expensive hoagie.Their sandwich and hoagie are freshly made. Nice location but if you don't park in the right location you will get a ticket so if you're going to get lunch and spend 600 get a $25.00 dollar or $35.00 dollar ticket. Is a family home business in all of the workers are very nice. They have salad fresh fruit chips is like a little supermarket they have holde trays meatball trays and roast beef trays. Picking up lunch for myself and my husband this is a late lunchIf you don't mind the ultimate in BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE from the deli chick, then this could be your spot. 
Being from Philadelphia Bad Customer Service goes without saying.  But what I received today was over and beyond. what I'm willing to put up with.
She must Hate her job or the people brave enough to order. Something is broke!I always go in there with my NY swag to order a Kawnbeef special on Kaiser with pickles. Then I like to add some chips and a drink to make it around 5 bucks. The prices are so good! Parking is so bad! 
They only accept cash! Also, be aware that this like a hole-in-a-wall good place. But, the sandwiches are fresh MTO.
I don't know any other place like this!I found out about this place on Parking Wars - my go-to for finding good food jk.  In the episode the PPA guy said that he tickets cars all day at the corner of midvale and ridge.  The people come out crying bc "they were only parking there for a minute" and all these excuses as their car is hanging out into the intersection.  So I guess we are allowed to do anything we want in this world as long as its only for a minute.  Drive 120 mph, rob a guy, rob a bank, double park, etc.  
Anyways, I love the HONEY TURKEY hoagie from here.  It's Carolina honey turkey but they must inject it with extra honey because that meat is sweeeeet.  I shall get one today!
* "Everything" includes-mayo or must AND oil, L, O, T, hot pep,s & p, oreg*
**Cash only....ATM at the Sunoco across the street ($1.50 surcharge)**
***Park legally!  Or Garfield will boot you!***
****Cheap - small hoag $3, large hoag $4****I like their hoagies....Who doesn't?!  I just wish they would spruce up the place a bit and not have the cigarette ads.I love Majors! And have for years. Recently I've gotten Turkey ham and honey turkey hoagies/ sandwiches. Both were really good and fresh. They have every snack you could imagine and they even sale fruit salads.
I just want to add it's best to call and order because they're always busy plus COVID-19. Because of the virus they're only allowing a certain amount of people in at a time which also have created a little wait time. So basically just plan ahead.I was told how good the hoagies are and my spiritual daughter, Rita, was so right. I had a spicy Turkey hoagie on a wheat roll, it was soo fresh and delicious. They will not see the last of me and I will share my findings with everyone.Yes, $3.75 per hoagie at Major Wing Lee's hole-in-the-wall market in Philly (off Kelly drive near Museum Dist). ---- My husband was in the neighborhood running an errand and we realized he was near a hoagie shop we'd seen on the show "Parking Wars"--supposedly everyone goes to pick up their Major's hoagie, and it's crazy congested because the hoagies are so cheap and good that people flock there in droves to risk life, limb, and a parking ticket, just to get their mouth around a Major's hoagie--oh, and there's an endless line out the door... Well, no one was manic, just hungry. And there was a line, but not out the door. My husband called ahead, had cash, and made sure to park legally so all went well. He didn't see PPA. Not quite the excitement A&E created on TV but I am not shocked. What did shock me was that a foot-long hoagie was $3.75--STUNNED! 
We have to say thumb's up. These are not the best we have ever had, but they are still pretty good for sure. AND for $3.75 each we get 2 for the price of one at our regular place. The meats are not top-of-the-line, but a few notches up from Wawa and Wawa's 4-inch hoagie still costs more than Major's 1-footer. So, I had to share this because it is a crazy good price. I also posted the photo of the menu and tape measure so you can see the size of it and the price in the menu (as of May 2013).Best place to go for some good ol' fashioned pasta salad, potato salad, and even assorted fruit salad! Not to mention they may have some of the best hoagies around! If you pass up the  chance to  grab a quick snack or lunch for the crew you're missing out on this dope corner store deli! Don't forget to say Hey to Jimmy!They do not understand English or speak it and are the rudest people ever.  Your order is always fucked up no matter what but it is the cheapeast sandwich you will find.Italian sandwich was delish and only $2.75
Good service, fresh food and all reasonably priced.I can't believe that I've never left a yelp for my favorite hoagie  place in the whole wide world!!! 
I am from Philly, we don't buy "subs" we eat HOAGIES! I'm from Philly, we don't go to Pat's and Geno's for a cheesesteak-we go to our local restaurant or we travel to Delassandro's in Roxborough lollll...I don't speak for all of PHL but I have to speak for all of us when it comes to a hoagie /steak lolll anyhow...I would argue and debate with anyone that this spot has the best hoagies, I honestly can't even go anywhere else for a hoagie unless hoagies are $5 on sale at wawa and I'm super starving....
All of the cold cuts are freshly sliced as you order, and they offer tuna and meatball sandwiches as well....they even do party platters. You can expect a line, because this is a popular spot-but the line goes by fast--folks come from all over for a hoagies---the tomatoes, the lettuce, the mayo, the cheese the fresh daily Amorroso rolls...I mean these hoagies are good to the last drop or oregano seed or oil if you choice to top your hoagie off with such a topper. 
Did I mention that I've been coming here since I can remember? I would give this place 10 stars if I could simply because they are consistent and the sister and brother that run the business are very respectable...this is a family owned organization and they value their customers! 
Atleast once every two weeks I have to come here for my craving and get my biweekly dose of a "majors hoagie". 
You must try this spot ! I PRomise that your won't regret it. 
I forgot to post a pic of my hoagie because I quickly gobbled it all down.I like majors but today was a bit different. Now, I like to think of myself as the perfect customer, I come in I gather my things then I pay and then I leave. Today I came in and gathered my things went to the counter to pay but whoever the store security or "watcher" is made a really rude comment that I really didn't appreciate it was kinda racist and for a store whose major customer base is African American you really need to watch that shit because you got the good daughter today and not the nasty one.I appreciate this place. Do I wish there was a Trader Joes here. Maybe. Ok. No i dont. This family is a bodega in a world loosing its bodegas. Go for the deli. Pick up a bag of apples and last minute box of pasta on the way out.Best Hoagies! And guess what? They have 2 other locations. I live in West Philadelphia and I was traveling to East Falls. Now I go to Yeadon which is 10 minutes away from me. They actually put more meat on it. They are all relatives. Grandmother , uncle, cousins etc.etc. There is a total of 3 locations.Major Wing Lee's reminds me of the old corner store's of my youth growing up in Philly.  This is a small market on the corner and small and tight on the inside.  Remember you are here on a mission to get a cheap hoagie - go to the back - place your order - stay focused...LOL
The hoagies are cheap and fresh - $2.25 - $3.75 - Nothing particularly different or fancy - just a good sandwich.  This is great for lunch option or if you need to grab a bite for the evening after a long day at work.  The store is small and cramped--you feel a lil overwhelmed by the inventory -- Some basic items are overpriced!  Up side- Always friendly service and you can call ahead to place orders.I love coming to Majors for 1 reason. Really inexpensive great hoagies. I ordered a small Italian Hoagie which is plenty for lunch. It's at least 6 in. and is packed with meat and veggies. Only $2.75!! Combine that with a $.50 bag of chips and a $.99 Arizona Tea and your whole meal is $4.25. I have this down to a science! Major Wing Lee= Best hoagies in East Falls.I finally got to this store to buy one of their "legendary" hoagies that folks are getting tickets for. I went to back to place my order, some rude gentleman cut in front of me and another young lady. Once I placed my order, I was given no eye contact. I just saw the top of a head yelling "next"!. The woman that assembled my sandwich was rude and sarcastic. I gave specifics on what I wanted on my sandwich and she kept telling me what she " usually doesn't do", as if she was doing me a favor. See, the old me would have attempted to reach behind that counter and yank her by her face but I digress...
My highlight was the gentleman that rang up my order. Very nice and pleasant, thus the 3 stars.
Overall, the hoagies were okay for the price but not worth a parking ticket or the attitude. Cool store to stop at if you're passing through the neighborhood.Major Wing Grocery Market, or Major's is a little neighborhood corner market that does an incredible Hoagie and sandwich business. The sandwiches are not spectacular or original, but they are very fresh and tasty and most of all-cheap. You can still purchase a small Hoagie for only $2.25!!! The large Hoagie is only $3.25 to $3.75 and the special Hoagies which contain premium quality cold cuts top off at $5.00. I usually call ahead and I order the large Meatball sandwich with sweet peppers, grated parmesan cheese and hot seeded pepper for only 5 bucks. They are super busy, but super fast too. Just watch out for the Parking Authority, they are on the prowl, enthusiastically passing out grief in these tough economic times(go figure). If you want a quick bite that won't hurt the budget, major's is the place to be.Cheap Prices, Cheap Service. The process is very rushed and the ladies hear what they want to hear. I had to argue for five minutes because she refused to believe or understand that I did not want mayo on my sandwich. And it did not seem to be a language barrier thing, it was a "I don't care enough to listen to what you are saying so hurry up" thing. I was trying to get mayo on two and not on the other which was a challenge. I just gave up and said "no mayo" on all. If she would slow down, and listen more, they wouldn't have so many issues. I see from other reviews that I am not the only one who had this issue here. They don't even write things down, and when you are placing an order for 3 hoagies and she wants to know what are now so she can make them at once, its just not a good sign. 
The hoagies are good and you get quality (D&W) meats for $3-5. By the time I left, the line was through the store.great sandwiches great prices  and fast services and ALWAYS A THANK YOU    PHILLY S    BEST I THINKMajor Wing Lee is an very cool grocery store.  Some items are very cheap.  Some items as cheap as a quarter but buy your milk elsewhere.  5 bucks for a 1/2 gallon?!  I wish my lady didn't NEED to bake cookies on such short notice.
Have not tried the subs but everyone RAVES about them... Including my neighbors who have lived in the neighborhood for 14 years now.
BTW:  Park legally.  If you end up on parking wars, you'll look like an ass.
