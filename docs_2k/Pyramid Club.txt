We host lots of events here and the staff is super friendly and it's clean with gorgeous views!Meh. 
My boyfriend got a travelzoo deal for us to try this spot out. I think it was $65ish, but you are forced to pay 20% gratuity which they unfortunately did not deserve. 
FOOD:
Scallops: 3 stars. These were actually cooked perfectly. Seared on the outside, not overcooked. However, the seasoning was mediocre.. which seems to be a trend .. really lacked salt aspect. Beautiful presentation
Bread -- probably my favorite part  :/ I liked all the assorted breads they give you (see photo). Cheddar bread, multigrain, and like a garlic cheesy stick
Salmon with asparagus and fingerling potatoes: presentation was beautiful. However, really lacked any seasoning again. The fish was flakey, and well cooked. however, i had to add like 3 pinches of salt, and I do NOT eat salty.. that's my sister :p
The asparagus and potatoes were again cooked to a perfect tenderness, but no seasoning. 
Tiramisu - disappointing. The taste was on point.. but it was mostly cream and no cake
SERVICE: way too noob
I must say, the lady that served us that night was very friendly. But as much as I've dined out and understand the restaurant world, a lot of things were just unacceptable.
"Would you like to start of with something to drink?"
Me: Sure, the  Leinenkugel's Summer Shandy, and my boyfriend had some sort of porter..  Anyway she comes back saying
"I'm sorry, can you point both on the menu. This menu is new"
Sorry, but that's really unprofessional. I don't care if the menu is new. Every restaurant owner and manager, should REQUIRE all employees to know the menu backwards and forwards. Even the hostesses are required to know these things.
Second instance:
" Do you have any questions about the menu, or are you ready to order?"
"Actually, what is the soup for the day?"
Server: Oh.. let me go check, I don't know.
COME ON
Needless to say, I will not be returning.Food is horrible!  White bread and ok cold cuts that reminds me of what I ate circa 1975.  Great facilities and an excellent view of the city but don't go there for the food.The Pyramid Club is a Private Club that serves gourmet meals, offers weekly event specials, and has meeting rooms available to members.  Located on the 52 Floor of the Mellon Center Building,  with in the walls of the Pyramid Club, beautiful views of the entire city, including the Art Museum, "U of P" Campus, Penn's Landing, and the N.J. Waterfront, all while you dine.  Class all the way!  What makes this a 5 Star, is the combination of Ambience, Excellent Service, and Fine Food.  
   Pyramid Club offers a separate Bar, Great Wine List, as well as Signature Cocktails such as their Winter Punch, a fine Kentucky Bourbon!  I started off with the Smoked Salmon Flatbread appetizer, a perfect balance of Smokey Salmon, Cheese, and Balsamic Vinegar. My Date thoroughly enjoyed her Shrimp Cocktail. Plump, Juicy, Jumbo Shrimp with a unique, tasty Cocktail sauce. Fresh, Hot Breads including a Dark Date Bread, German Brotchens, and Flat Breads & Bread Sticks with a Premium Butter.
  We picked the Chateau Tanunda Grand Barossa Shiraz from Australia, A Full Bodied, Shiraz with light overtones of smoke, fruit, and just the right amount of tannins.  My Date loved the Crab Crusted  Grilled Swordfish with Wilted Spinach on top of a Smoked Cheddar Grit Cake.  I "Loved the "Southern Style Pan Seared Chicken Breast, Bacon Potato Hash, Braised Mustard Greens, Topped with a Toasted Sugar Bourbon Butter.
  To finish, The NY Cheese Cake was an Excellent Choice, going PERFECTLY with the Shiraz.  My Date had the Pumpkin Crème Brulee, which had the perfect Balance of Pumpkin and Sweetness, but neither overpowering.  From the time you check your coat, to the time you leave, you will be treated greeted, and treated like a VIP!  
  I will be planning future get togethers here at the Pyramid Club!!  A real Winner in Philly perfect for a date, or to impress clients.
ENJOY!! CHEF GARY CURRYI went to some college fundraiser here.  This is where the movers and shakers and white people with money in Philadelphia like to go to pretend they're not big fish in a small pond. 
It's all cherry and leather and resplendent in GOPness.  It's a private club, but it's run by ClubCorp so it's kind of weird, not like the Union Club that's kind of organic elitism. This place is relatively new and set up to be a private place--so weirdNot nearly as nice as the Union League - but the food is good and maybe even better here - plus you have those gorgeous views of the city.
For a holiday party ofr networking event - it's a great spot.  As long as someone else is paying - I'll be there.  But there is NO WAY I'd join as a a member.  Too much money.
They easily accomodate large or small groups and have some meeting rooms that are cozy for the small ones.Absolutely beautiful location/views and the food and service where not far off. Wife and I went there on a Friday night for a couples night out. We had a corner table that looked south and west. Note to self. Don't sit looking west during the evening - the sunset is a killer, but beautiful. Our server was a little over the top friendly, if there is such a thing and the meal progressed slowly. However the food was terrific. My wife started with the strawberry salad and I got the lobster bisque. We then each got the shrimp cocktail,  which was presented in a totally different way. For dinner my wife had a chicken on the bone and I had this outstanding bacon wrapped monkfish. Yeah, I said it - bacon wrapped monkfish. So good. Dessert was great as I had a banana foster creme brulee  and my wife had sorbet mixture of mint and mango. Coffee was excellent.Delicious food with a gorgeous view! Highly recommend going at night to see Philly all lit up. I ordered the halibut which came with housemade gnocchi and sautéed asparagus. The fish was perfectly cooked and paired nicely with the buttery pan-seared gnocchi! I came here for a birthday dinner and all the staff were very friendly dropping in to wish her a happy birthday!Came here for a business lunch and, while I was blown away by the views of the city, I was underwhelmed by the food.  Thank goodness I wasn't paying.  It's your typical country club-esque feel (agree with another user who described it as all cherry and leather).  Staff are all very nice and the service was fine.  Prices are inflated and I guess expected given the atmosphere.  
I was excited to see falafel with hummus on the menu (because aren't crab cakes just so cliche?) but I can assure you what I got was neither falafel nor edible.  The highlight of the meal was the small basket of onion bread in the middle of the table and the chocolate cookies near coat check.  
Stick to crab cakes?I'm a huge fan of this location. The food is great and the service is always wonderful. Although, I do have one complaint - parking. It should be advertised and guests should be advised on it's location prior to arriving. The wine selection is appropriate and the crowd is somewhat nouveau riche but without the attitude.We went there with a group of 14 for dinner.  I ordered the filet, medium well.  Specifically told the waiter, " no pink".  My filet came and it was blood red.  The person sitting next to me who initially said she would trade (she had ordered medium rare) said no, mine was too rare for her.  I sent it back.  The entire table had finished their meals and my meal had still not come.  I told them to forget it at that point and to take my meal off the bill which they did.  Also, this is a group at which the wine usually flows copiously.  We ended up having to find the bottles and pouring our own wine.  Had the waiter been more attentive we would easily have ordered 2 to 3 more bottles of wine.  Beautiful view but very disappointing service.    Deserts were a mixed bag.  Some were  very good (pistachio gelato), others were forgettable (pumpkin tart).  Would not recommend due to the disappointing service.Very impressive, beautiful prestigious building, break taking view, delicious Spanish food, very helpful and pleasent staff.A group of us went there last week for an award dinner.Ironically,the food we were served wIll never win any awards.The only thing edible was the asparagus,and that was tasteless.As this was a banquet meal we didn't select what we were served.However, if our selection was on a menu it would be best described as "Chicken Sahara"Dry,tasteless,without a hint of flavor.With a side of wallpaper paste that was either risotto or potatoes.Great venue!!! I worked a gig here and I must say - the respect they showed me was phenomenal.   Usually when working events I am treated as hired help at the venues but not here. They went above and beyond to make sure I was fed **excellent** food and continuously checked to see if I needed anything as they would any other guest.
I will highly recommend this place for the following reasons:
- the view
- the food
- the decor
- the staff
Good job guys - keep it up!I went to the Pyramid Club for the first time for a networking and social event launching a partnership between the Philadelphia Junior Chamber (Jaycees) and the Philly2night VIP Club last Wednesday evening.  
I came to this event as a Philly2night VIP Club member, and honestly did not know much about the Jaycees. After speaking with several of the Jaycees and the woman who organized the event, Liz, I realized that the organization was a wonderful integration of everything that young professionals need for success in the areas of business development, management skills, individual training, community service, and international connections. I will definitely be attending all of the events created by this new partnership. 
The Pyramid Club, itself, was wonderful--beautiful marble, gold, and cherry wood decor and breath-taking views of the city from every corner. It was impressive and professional without being stuffy or intimidating. It is a country club on the 52nd floor, but not in a bad way.
And, of course, the $25 Two Hour (serve yourself!) Open Bar with wine, beer, and food..that was pretty fantastic, too. The wine and beer selection was diverse and would appeal to a wide variety of people. I know I was pleased with the Pinot Grigio offered. The food was great and included Philadelphia "classics" such as, cheesesteak spring rolls, flatbread pizzas, and homemade soft pretzels. 
The staff was great. Doreen was delightful! She was very attentive and friendly, constantly checking with each guest to see that everything was perfect. Everyone was very engaging and not at all aloof or disinterested.  A super-friendly dining operations supervisor, Mike, was also on the floor at all times and the well-being of each guest and the success of each event was his utmost priority.  
Overall, I was very impressed. It was a wonderful (and fun!) evening and I look forward to attending another event at The Pyramid Club. Hopefully soon!
Also, if you aren't a Philly2night VIP member, you should definitely consider joining. Check it out! http://zfer.us/e2qDgNice ambiance and service and good food. The meat and cheese appitizer was HUGE and could have easily been for 4 people. :-)I am a member of the Pyramid Club and am so glad that I joined. It is a well run establishment with great food, great service and fun events.  This is a nice place to take an out of town guest or to celebrate a special event. It kind of reminds me of either the Rainbow Room in Manhattan or what used to be Windows on the World in the World Trade Center prior to 9/11This place is a hidden gem. I came here for a private party on the 51st floor and was pleasantly surprised. 
First off I was greeted by friendly staff that quickly took our coats and directed us to our area. Upon entering the private rooms you become surrounded by amazing views of the city. Instead of walls there are huge panes of glass for city viewing. 
The servers brought appetizers of jumbo cocktail shrimp and crab cake bites. They were very friendly and made sure everyone was included. The bar staff was also efficient and friendly.
Dinner was served in hot metal trays. The ravioli and pasta was decent. They also provided a salad station for custom salad creation.
Overall a very classy establishment that is perfect for corporate, networking, alumni or any private event.*Note: I attended an event at the Pyramid Club. This review is only for the space as a venue.
First, let's tackle the obvious: the view is fantastic. Fifty-two floors above the city of Philadelphia, you can look out the towering windows to see incredible feats of architecture, bridges, waterways, and of course New Jersey. It's worth attending an event here for the breathtaking view and butterfly-like feeling of vertigo alone.
The shape of the space - a long rectangle - does present some challenges as a venue, however. When vendors' tables are set up around the perimeter of the room, it limits one's access to the windows. I'm shameless when trying to get a good picture, but at times capturing a shot did require apologetically climbing over vendors' things and getting behind their booths. The buffet table was set up on the short side of the room by the main door, and there were vendor tables beside it. This made it difficult for people to access those tables when there was a line for the buffet, and difficult to tell who was in line for food and who was in line for the vendors. On the other side of the buffet table you had to contend with people coming and going through the door. The table and the heating tray things keeping the hot food hot were also obstructing more windows. I still got pictures, of course, but it wasn't easy.Note: This reivew is for en event that took place here, not the dining experience.
View was absolutely breathtaking! To see the entire city lit up at night was all that was needed. :-)
Came here this past weekend for the Alzheimers Junior Association Masquerade Ball. Everything was so well organized. Right when we walked into the building, there was someone at the bottom of the elevator waiting and pushes the button for you. Then going up the elevator, there are 2 people waiting at a table to check you in. They let you know that a picture will be taken right when we walk upstairs so they recommended us putting on our mask. The photographers they hired are so nice! They took our picture, complimented our masks, and pointed us to the party area.
They had photobooth, magician, bartenders, appetizer servers, small food table, auctioned items, and dj. It was so much fun. And all the entertainment and servers were beyond nice! They really know what they are doing and do a great job
For the food - loved the mac n cheese! Mmm, so creamy and absolutely delicious. The also really enjoyed the pork sliders. The cheeseburger sliders wasn't really doing it for me. Kind of dry. They also had veggies, but they were all RAW. I thought some of the stuff would have been steamed or something, but nope. As for the appetizers, sooo good! The chicken empanadas were one of my favorites. They also had coconut chicken on a stick, eggrolls, stuffed mushrooms. Dessert were mini cupcakes by Sweet Ts bakeshop. Omg...it was heaven in my mouth. :-)
I def want to check this place out during a regular meal.Absolutely stellar experience. Excellent service starts from the moment you walk up the stairs. Once seated we took a few minutes to take in the amazing views and then they brought us bread. 
So let's stsrt with the bread. Little white rolls with some sort of sea salt in them and excellent flavor. Cracker type things that were like everything bagels on a cracker. Pumpernickel, a few crackers and a couple of other rolls round out the basket. All of it delicious, we asked for a refill which they gave us gladly. 
The menu is small, but the food was excellent. For appetizers I had fried oysters and they were very tasty. My friend had their tomato soup which he said was ok and our wives each had the beet salad which they loved.
On to the main course. I had the Friday special, surf and turf, and it was awesome. The steak was very flavorful and cooked properly, the lobster was fully off the shell and excellent, and the cauliflower and potatoes were tasty as well. I would order this again any time. Absolutely wonderful. 
The desserts were excellent, and the service was stellar throughout. The only thing that wasn't top notch was the coffee, which I found just average. 
I would absolutely eat here again.Stunning venue! 
I was here this summer for a friend's wedding. Breath taking views, wonderful food and fantastic company add up to a great recipe for one memorable night. The room has tall glass windows with an almost 360 degree view of the city. It is romantic and contemporary.  
Mind you, the elevator does not go all the way up, it stops one level below and you have to take the stairs. So if you are wearing heels, it's something to keep in mind ;)
PS. Since I was here for a wedding reception, I can't comment on the dining experience...yet!Went to an affair last night and the had worst banquet food I ever had. We had a debate at our table at one point to decide if the glob on our plate was the worst mashed potatoes or the worst risotto we had all ever had. Banquet food is hard but not that hard.Used a travelzoo deal for a romantic dinner. Really enjoyed the following:
- city views
- intimate environment
- food
- friendly staff
I don't think I would go here without a deal since the total $ i spent using the deal was around $120-140.Our Firm had a private dinner at the Pyramid Club.  The entrees that we picked was #1 Filet Minion and Shrimp and #2 chicken Florintine.  The Filet was the equivalent of Roast beef quality, and was tough and lacked taste.  The chef forgot that shrimp should have been included, and therefore it was missing from our meals.  I did not have the chicken, but heard from others that it was rubbery.  Salad and dessert was decent, however most in our party of 40 were thoroughly disappointed.  I would not recommend having a catered dinner there.I have been here for several events and this is basically a country club on the 50th floor, except that it caters mostly to the business crowd, although they will hold graduation and debutante events in the evening.  The food here is quite good, but the bar is excellent.  As can be expected, the service is wonderful and it offers a nice view of the city.  You do have to be a member to enjoy the amenities, but certainly if you have a lot of business luncheons and events to plan, I would consider joining.My husband & I made reservation to celebrate our anniversary with a special deal from the Travelzoo.  There was only 1 party of 2 in the dining room, but the host "forced" us to sit in the bar area for our drink & appetizer.  When we were finished, we were given a bill for that portion (plus 20% service charge) before bringing us into the dining room.  The food was better than average, but not good enough to remember.  The place got filled up after a while, and there were definitely some who acted like they "belonged" there (as a Club member).  At the end of the meal, we were presented with another check for the "dining room" portion, plus another 20% service charge.  What got me was that the bill specified that "the service charge is not a tip or gratuity"; on the other hand, Travelzoo stated on its instruction that "no gratuity is required".  That was misleading, to say the least!  With the 20% service charge and our tip (another 18%), we surely paid a steep price for this so-so meal.  There is a better way (and a better place) to spend our money.When a young woman was harassed by an employee they took no effort and instead found it funny.We went there for Easter brunch and the food was amazing!  We can't wait to go back for dinner next week.  I joined about 2 years  ago and it's really been such a great decision.  I would recommend joining to anyone who wants a great place to bring clients or just a cool place to hang out with some friends!Joined my parents for their anniversary dinner. They arrived late for their reservation, but the place was completely empty except for one other group on a Tuesday evening (7pm). The staff was friendly and knowledgable on the menu options. It has a beautiful ambiance, and spectacular view.
However, our food was underwhelming. It arrived warm (not hot) to the point my mother had to ask for her appetizer to be reheated. My waiter got my food wrong- twice. Once our entrees arrived, they were also not served hot, and underwhelming. The menu made everything sound so delicious and flavorful, but my crab cake sandwich could have been prepared at home! 
If you want to impress someone, I highly suggest taking them here. If you are looking for a delicious and filling meal, visit a different spot.I've always been intrigued by the Pyramid Club because of its exclusive nature and finally got the opportunity to attend an evening affair this summer and whew...the vibe was uber sexy! Incredible views of the City of Brotherly Love from the 52nd floor. If you're feeling down, just try to find an event to attend at the Pyramid Club or be a guest of a member - you'll instantly feel up (literally lol).
Staff is really accommodating, professional, and down to earth and the ambiance doesn't feel too uppity like how you would imagine a members only environment could be. But even more importantly, let's talk about the food! Hands down the best Impossible Burger in the city...or in fact, the best one I've had to date (and I've had quite a few ranging from Cali to NY). The secret - request the Impossible Burger with the Pyramid Burger toppings...super scrumptious!Disregard earlier reviews! New chef Nicholas Cassidy is turning out exciting versions of old favorites. We were a group of foodies unsure about the small but well-rounded menu, and instead were astonished at what came out of the kitchen. Very innovative and highly recommended.Great staff, food and view.   On the 52nd floor in downtown Philly. They have parking accommodations as well, to make the trip I to the city much easier.My review isn't based on dining here rather its on a travelzoo gift that I gave to older friends who have been mentors in my entire adult life. I thought it would be lovely to send them to sky line dining experience (just a random act of kindness). Every time they tried to make reservations they were given the run around. Eventually they grew tired of trying and let the vouchers expire. The money was credited back to my account but the experience was upsetting. I received another email with a similar offer here and it rekindled bad memories. To make up for it I just bought them a gift card to dine at the Ritz Carlton and gave them a bottle imported white wine.Super server. Delicious hummus appetizer and strip loin steak and filet mignon and branzino. Very nice and creative seasoning. Tasty blueberry tart and excellent latte.  The restaurant is very comfortable, not crowded, and noise level quite low.Took hubby there to celebrate his birthday.....WONDERFUL CHOICE!
We had a blast!
Food was fantastic, view was breathtaking and our server Mafdy was AWESOME. 
If You haven't been there yet, I suggest you give a try and ask for MafdyWe went on a travelzoo coupon.  As soon as we got there the disaster began.  We were told we could not sit in the bar, as the coupon indicated, because there was a private party.  (Why did they allow us to make a reservation then?) The options were very limited for appetizers and came to the table lukewarm.  Then things got worse.  We were presented with a bill in which they had not taken off anywhere close to the proper amount for the travelzoo coupon.  When I questioned this, I was told "Oh, we took off $3 for your drink." (Drinks were included in the deal.)  A manager was called over, who refused to get our coupon and said he had never had anyone with a coupon for just drinks and appetizers.  I had to pull it up on my phone.  He then left for about 15 minutes.  We got up to find him and he was working on the computer.  Another couple was waiting because they had had virtually the same experience.  I finally overpaid and left so I wouldn't get a parking ticket.  It's a shame since the view (when you are allowed to be in the area where you can see it) is beautiful.My boyfriend and i had the most amazing meal and experience here! Impeccable service from our server, Kasey Jones, who gave us the best wine rec and made the night so enjoyable! And the food was the best we've had in awhile (compliments to the chef)! Anyone who is looking for a serene and romantic dinner made special by good food and nice people (who know their way around a wine cellar), check this place out  and ask for  Kasey Jones! Not to mention it's 52 floors up with a breathtaking view of Philly. We will be returning to meet up with Kasey and Company!We received a well-meaning Travelzoo giftcard to dine here from my mom. I called a few days ahead of the desired dining date (our anniversary) to make a reservation. "We're booked Friday," they said. That's fine. Friday's busy. I made the reservation for Tuesday, spending about ten minutes on the phone verifying my information and the travelzoo voucher number. The guy seemed bothered by me. 
Our reservation was for 7:30 and we received a phone call at 7:20 asking, "So will this be a cancellation for your 7:30 reservation?" No, I explained. We were in the elevator. Literally minutes from the restaurant. Sorry? We arrived at 7:22, looking fly.
After our Travelzoo voucher was stamped (lol) and handed from receptionist to hostess to waiter like a badge of shame. "Enjoy your dinner, you cheap buttheads," I imagined them saying.
We were seated in a completely empty room after and given menus. We chose a $38 bottle of wine, apps and entrees (the voucher was good for a free app, free entrée, and free dessert per person). The appetizers were ok. My entrée was trout, swimming in a sea of butter and oil. I had to season it with salt.  My boyfriend's entrée was ok, it was like a seafood stew of some sort. The desserts were ok. The food was not dissimilar to what I would imagine a rich, heavy white guy would have his chef make.  A man who drowns his sorrows in butter. 
Then we were handed a bill for $80. Pfft. 
It was super awkward as we were literally the only people in the dining room throughout the entire meal. 
I'm sad because I heard the food was good. Do they serve different food to the club members than they do the Travelzoo peasants?  Two stars, cause the view was cool.Lovely place to host private events. Great location. Spacious. He staff is amazing. Also the food is delicious. I would definitely keep this place in mind for next Company event.The pyramid club is located on top of a high-rise building in downtown Philadelphia there is plenty of parking in garage is nearby and you can call ahead to see if they have any specific recommendations
The club is very stylish and both the  dining room and lounge area are very generous in their seating arrangements And you don't feel crowded
We were able to die in there when the cloud cover was coming in and the views from the restaurant are amazing
We all enjoyed our entrées that were prepared very well and with the type of presentation you would expect in a higher end restaurant
The wine list was also extensive and fairly priced.
We were pleased with our night out at the pyramid club and would recommendI would like to review the cherries. For a $20 old fashioned I WANT MORE. Bringing luxardo level prices, show me the goods. Cheap ass cherry clowns.Their heat and serve and wine packages are great.  With such hard times they are doing their best to provide quality products in your own home.  They have also just redone their in club dining menus and the dishes that I have tried so far are delicious, as well as their wine pairings and cocktails.Stuffy and dated feel as soon as I walked in. They also have an outdated dress code policy that you should check. We did a private corporate event here and I had no point person on the day of our event. I was pointed down a hallway to the room where no one greeted me. I grabbed a server in the hallway and asked where guests could put their coats and bags, and he told me guests could put their things "On the floor against the wall". REALLY?
I made friendly eye contact with anyone wearing a name tag, and not one person greeted me or offered assistance. Everyone seemed distracted by other events. When I attempted to flag down a host with a question about service, she promptly spun around and walked down another hallway. 
We were assured the room would suit our needs but it was entirely too large and felt empty, making it look like our event was a failure (We had 90%+ attendance, but the room was just too large for our headcount!) There were also LOTS of hidden fees (more than I've seen at most venues we've worked with) which ran our bill up QUICKLY. We found ourselves cutting corners to stay on budget, and the food was not worth the prices they charged. Be sure you read that contract CLOSELY! 
I was stationed at a registration table welcoming our guests all night and not a single server came by to to see if I needed anything (I had to leave my post to wait in a bar line for a glass of water, and was never offered food that was served to our guests.) This was a first for me, since I've done countless marketing events and most servers are kind enough to stop by to see if things are going well of if anything is needed. The desserts were good (but overpriced). The other food was extremely lackluster. I would not book another event here. 
I would give it one star, but upped to two stars because the view is good (Lucky for them for securing space on the 52nd floor because there's not much else to offer!) and the communication of the event planners was always prompt. They answered all my questions, but when it came to the day of the event, I felt like I had no point of contact on site to help with simple things like helping our guests find restrooms and hang coats.The Pyramid Club, named for obvious reasons, is atop the former Mellon Bank Building, but as of 2009, is now the Bank of New York Mellon (BNYM), but I'm sure people still refer to it as Mellon. 
I visited (way) back in 2002-3, preparing for a friends bridal shower.  This was the only destination I considered in town until she decided to have her festivities out of state. 
Timothy was the consultant I had met with that day, and he gave me a thorough tour of the facilities. I didn't get to try any food during my visit, but it appears to be a hit or miss. For special events, there were numerous rooms to choose from, from smaller, intimate conferences to larger, grand banquets. And of course, everyone here has pointed out the views are unmatched from other high rises in Philadelphia due to the layout, regardless of which direction was faced. 
I am surprised this kind of place has started accepting TravelZoo deals and the like, but then again, I haven't been this way in over a decade. Guess they have changed their status quite a bit? 
Cheesy fact: I was first exposed to this establishment since Savage Garden held a private fan meet up here years prior. No, I did not go.5 Tuna Poke Bowl/ sushi rice, mango, avocado, fresh seaweed: Have had this dish a number of times and it always consistently delicious. The ingredients are always fresh. Even though the dish is packed with flavor you never feel overwhelmed afterwards.
Overall 5: Food is pretty consistent. They will change the menu seasonally. They offer fresh bread to start. If you have a gluten allergy they offer, gluten free crackers.  Really nice wine selection. A few of the wines from South Africa are highly recommended! Staff is always very friendly and attentive. Great views of the city.***This review is only for their New Year's Eve Event ***
I saw on IG that the Pyramid Club was having a New Year's Eve Party.  Read some of the reviews on Event Bright and thought we try something different than our usual spot (for the last 2 years) the Moshulu.  http://www.moshulu.com/
The Pyramided is in the BNY Mellon Center on the 52 Floor in Center City Philly.  They're known for having one of the best views of the City for fireworks. They got me at fireworks.  I'm a sucker for anything that sparkles.  
The package included 5 hours open bar, butler passed Hors Oeuvres, buffet station, desserts and Champagne Toast.  Doors open at 8:30 pm.  
We arrived around 9:30 pm and the only food available was dessert...Really?  This place had multiple rooms but everyone was small including the dance floor.  And to think we almost went with the VIP room which was no bigger than the non-VIP rooms.  The view to see the fireworks were ok.
I don't see us coming back when I can get everything and more (much better view, plenty of food and an awesome DJ) at the Moshulu.Thank you Travelzoo for helping me avoid a financial disaster! Sometimes you have to be careful if you follow so called buzz about well known dining and exclusive restaurants or clubs. I'm so thankful for Yelp, I read the reviews so I was prepared for what I would possibly experience, meh! I wasn't disappointed because the reviews weren't that favorable and I split the cost of the Travel Zoo deal and the automatic 20% gratuity.  Can't see me doing this again as I was not impressed!
The best thing about this place is the view and our very attentive server Imani (sp). Although we were under a thunderstorm watch and the clouds were ominous the view was still beautiful. We were served a variety of warm rolls and whipped butter. For my appetizer I had the King Crab Tempura it was good, not special. My entrée I had the Smoked Duck Breast which I asked to be cooked medium well, it still came out medium but whatever I went with it. Finally I had espresso gelato it was tasty but not as good a the Icery in Lansdowne!Good music, drinks and food! Would come for special occasion or just a nice night out.The view was beautiful.
I was really looking forward to coming here for a corporate event. I had pre-ordered the filet mignon and was very disappointed the night we were there when it came out and was beyond well done. I have never had such a dry, chewy, and tasteless filet mignon before in my life. Since it was a corporate event I tried my best to endure but gave up and left half on my plate. In conclusion, I would highly recommend this place for any event that did not involve food. The space is beautiful and the view amazing. Just don't try to eat here.Had my wedding here - lets get started.
Not going to make this a super long review, but I have a serious issue. First of all, the food was pretty good as were the apps. Service was decent except for our "personal waitress" who didn't speak English.
My issue - the open bar. So we paid for the premium upgraded bar, which was a 5 hour open bar from 6 to 11. Promptly at 9:00 they ran out of Makers Mark - my best mans drink of choice. At 9:30 they ran out of Crown Royal - MY drink of choice. At 10:00 they ran out of Scotch - my fathers drink of choice. I then confronted the manager and asked why someone from their staff wasn't out buying me, the guy who PAID for the wedding, a bottle of Crown Royal and I was told "we're not staffed for that". This is a COLOSSAL F up, one that is simply inexcusable. WHY WOULDN'T YOU HAVE ALL THIS STUFF IN STOCK? They had one bottle each of said liquors. To make matters worse no one would take accountable for the F up and all I get back is a gift certificate to the Pyramid club for one dinner. So basically at the end of the day we drop $25,000 on a wedding and get a bar that ran out of booze, not to mention it was the 3 best ones they had - which is WHY I paid the upgraded charge!
All in all, everything else was fine. It was a good wedding, but I cant let this go. This is a screw up that NEVER should have happened and I shouldn't be getting a gift certificate for dinner there in lieu of that screw up - I should be getting my money back for the upgraded bar and a reason this F up even happened in the first place.
If you plan on getting married here - make sure that you DEMAND they have appropriate stock on what they are charging you for because if they run out - they sure aren't giving you that money back.Great view.  The food tasted very good.  BUT not busy and we waited about 45 minutes for our dinner after we finished salad.  3 of the 4 meals were cold and the hot one came out 5 minutes after the other 3.  Again, the food tasted good but at about $40-$50 per entree, cold food is not OK.  I was surprised at how empty the place was on a Friday night.  Now I get it.After visiting The Pyramid Club for a scheduled wedding tour of the location we we're very displeased. The only nice facts of this club we're the girls at the front desk were very nice, and the views from there over looking the city were beautiful. After arriving we we're met by one of the women who dealt with weddings and she was very rude, we couldn't even view one of the rooms because there was a so called "meeting" in there (it looked empty to us) and the other area was so small I couldn't believe they held weddings in there. And not being a member they look at you snobby and also charge you an additional fee and your private event isn't so private when they were going to keep the club open during our wedding. Also the attitude and rudeness of this women was just unbelievable. She didn't even shake my fiance's hand before or after our meeting. They ask you to dress up to visit as it is a private club, well it looked like she had  sweatpants on, so why should we have to dress to the nines if their employees can't even look or act nice. A waste of time was what this place was, I wouldn't suggest to any of my friends getting married or to anyone wanting to join their "club".This is a members-only restaurant situated like an eagle's aerie towering atop one of Philadelphia's skyscrapers. Its in the Mellon Bank building? I forget.
Anyway..I vaguely remember... eating here.. for some reason. No idea why or how, since neither I or anyone I know is a member. It is an oddball place; upscale to the point of being stuffy; stiff and hoity; and the staff definitely 'rule-mongers' you beyond the point of frustration. Since its not a restaurant which depends on 'walk-ins', your papers better be in order.
'Every little thing' has to be correct about your reservation and attire and whatnot. It all befits the intense geometrical shape of the place; the crazy glass pyramid of icy, interlocking beams (like Jor-el's penthouse on the Planet Krypton). In retrospect, there really is something odd about a penthouse restaurant like this being 'members only'. Rather a heavy-handed 'message' in that, wouldn't you say? Not very 'American'.
The food was middling high-level; well-presented like you see in food magazines and precise enough to suit the decor..I mean, its not like they're going to do anything really wrong-- considering who their clientele is. Still, the food is  not much more creative than any of Philly's other finest restaurants at ground-level. I did enjoy the view ...but the place can be eerily, dead-empty on nights (like ours was) during the week when Philly's GOP crones and ghouls are all at the symphony (or perhaps home with hot-water bottles to ward off chills). My companion and I basically had the run of the joint. It was an experience.
It was hilariously vacant as we ate. Echoing, cerebral..Tralfalmodorian..perched up high like that above the city--well, just rather bizarre to be the only guests in a room full of empty tables. Dining in utter, rapt isolation like Keir Dullea in 2001:Space Odyssey, is very disorienting. Not exactly as 'fun' as it could be, since there's no other diners to enjoy it with. 
I suppose the place does conferences and presentations too, which would make sense. The grand dimensions of the space, exude a sort of  'suspense'. You keep looking over your shoulder, as if in the expectation that some powerfully wealthy tycoon is about to make his entrance and explain his plans for world domination, like in a James Bond movie.  Ehh. I'll take the hustle-and-bustle of the Capital Grille any day.Pyramid Club is atop the BNY Mellon Center in downtown Philadelphia. It happens to be the building I work in so ive been there quite a bit. It is night/day comparison (in a good way) of pre vs. post renovation. It is now a clean, modern and sophisticated bar/restaurant with superb views. 
Their food and beverage outlook is just ok, not great, not bad. It is certainly not a place you're going to for a specific item, there's no "gotta have-it's". 
If you're going here, ultimately it's for the view and atmosphere. 
 p.s. Theres even a small shuffleboard table... and I love shuffleboardwow just wow...spectacular dinner started with a super tasty pastrami salmon with caviar the kitchen gave out as a gift and amazing edible candles for bread??? I have never seen that before, very creative. shrimp app was very tasty, my friend had the cold tomato soup and loved it as well. The bass was good but i wish it had a tiny bit more salt. the raspberry dessert was phenomanal..I could eat 5 of them. We ate early and the live music started toward the end of our dinner but it was really nice. We are planning on coming back again!!!We went for Valentines Day. We sat down and my husband asked to see the scotch menu but they didn't have one. The server recited a couple of basic options, but nothing interesting on that menu at all. I ordered the prix fixe with the wine pairing. When I asked for my drink that came with the first course, it took 3 servers to figure out what I meant. They were too busy talking to each other in the corner to notice me. When the drink came 20 mins later, it was warm white wine. YUCK. We waited and waited but our app course never came at all. We had long finished our first drink and the bread, and then they brought out the entree course. We told them we never got the apps. They went back... another 20 mins later they brought out the wrong apps. So basically we ate nothing and we were there for almost 2 hours. This place needs to get its act together!! It was a real bummer.
