Nothing negative to say about this place. Some of the best cheese steaks I've ever had. Good amount of meat. Tasty peppers and mushrooms. Very fresh rolls. My new favorite in NE Philadelphia.One of the best cheesesteaks in the Northeast.  Fresh rolls with high-quality beef and REAL cheese whiz.  Fries are excellent as well.  Order on Grubhub for pickup or delivery, they have it down to a science.Lived in philly my whole life and I can honestly say this ranks in the top 2 cheesesteaks I've ever had. Really good cheesesteak! Will be headed back for sureI stopped by stoli steaks one day after work and was pleasantly surprised at how good the steaks are. this place uses NY strip that is fresh and tasty plus they use real wiz not that fake stuff.I would and I have recommended this place to my friends and family  I even told my ex wife so it must be good if I would share with her but now I might have to find s new steak place dam. LolI've basically tried every category in the entire menu and none of them has failed me. The quality of the food is really good and everything is well made. The cheesesteaks and chicken cheesesteaks are definitely good to start with if you aren't sure what to get (Stoli's Steaks right?) The burgers are also a good go-to choice that uses the same meat as the cheesesteaks and all of them are double patties.
There are other options for those you might like something different like grilled chicken and salads. The sides consist of sweet fries and regular fries and you can spice them up with seasoning or add some chili on top which is also really well made. The pork loin sandwhich is also really unique with slaw and has tons of meat on it. The store itself is also really nice so if you decide to eat in it is a pretty nice place to be.
Overall I'm pretty happy with the store and will be always coming back.Awesome cheese steaks!!! My new go to for a steak. Arrived hot, tastes fresh, fast deliveryThis place is a gem. As far as cheese steaks go, I've lived in philly for 26 years and tried just about every cheese steak, but this is definitely in my top 5. The fries were great , huge portion, the cheese whiz actually tastes like cheese , and the staff are super friendly and adorable. My sister , daughter and I all split a steak and fries and were super stuffed. Hope this place doesn't switch anything up.I had the chance to stop in at Stoli's a few weeks ago and it was terrific. The food was tremendous, it's priced reasonably, and the options are terrific. Don't miss out on the pickled tomatoes.
Everything tastes fresh, you can tell that there is great care put into running a great steak shop. The staff is personable, knowledgable and on top of things. The atmosphere is inviting and the food backs everything else up.
It's tucked away in a shopping center so it could be easy to miss, but this is one place you should make sure you DON'T miss. I'll definitely be back again!Excellent food! Friendly staff!! Definitely one of the best Cheesesteaks and Cheeseburgers, I've ever tasted! They use real portobello mushrooms! Absolutely tasty food!!!!!! 5 stars!!!!Best cheesesteak I've found after 3 years in Philly.  Local gem with folks who really invest in and deliver on their product. Eat here.Amazing cheesesteaks and fries.  Great atmosphere and friendly staff.  Keep up the quality work!I find it very hard to find good food in the north east of the "pizza shop" variety but  Stoli's steaks has some of the best cheesesteaks I've ever had. Delassandros is definitely my favorite, but Stoli's is a close second. It doesn't matter if I pick up or get it delivered, there is never a long wait. Food never disappoints, I recommend this place highly.The food is always amazing and quality of taste is always their concern. I've never had anything from there that I didn't like from their steak salads to their cheeseburgers and of course their cheesesteaks. My favorite is the mushroom steak. Their hot dogs are foot long Nathan's and you can get them almost anyway you can think of. Their barbecue sauce is also delicious if you like it on your burgers. Only thing to consider is their portions are sometimes too big so hopefully they consider smaller potions (single patties instead of just doubles) as additional menu items, but how can you really complain about getting too much? The staff is awesome and very personable. They introduced themselves to me the first time I went there and they call me by name whenever I stop by. Love this place.Went to Stoli's for my second time around 9:30 Saturday night. It's a difficult parking lot to get into with the traffic and busy intersection. The first time my mushroom steak and fries was good so it was worth a second visit. The help was more interested with phone orders, my pizza steak wasn't chopped well and was definitely mediocre for the price. I ordered a side ordered coleslaw this time and it tasted like it was near hot sauce at some point. The pickle and sweet pepper jars were nearly empty, maybe because of the time of day. Definitely disappointing for the price of they're products. Will not stop in there again.Went here last night. Always drove by shopping center didn't realize place was there. Storefront not that noticeable. Cousin found on yelp.

The overall product was slightly subpar (roll, meat, cheese) when compared to the big names.Came down to NE Philly for work training and my wife wanted cheesesteaks. Checked out a few places online and found Stoli's. FANTASTIC. The bread was delicious, the meat perfectly cooked and well seasoned. Picked them up at 4pm, drive back to jersey with them, had them at 630pm. I will definitely be making a day trip back to the area just for lunch!Mmm-Mmm, Mmmmmmm is all I could say with every bite of my perfectly made Stoli's Cheesesteak!! I was really craving a Cheesesteak tonight, and said "I'm going to Stoli's!!" I ordered on Grubhub thru my Yelp app, which is very convenient. Customer service is awesome, wait time was none, it was ready when I walked in!! My o-rings were golden and perfectly cooked, and I love their sweet/spicy pickles! I highly recommend this place if you love cheesesteaks!! 5 stars and two thumbs up!! Thank you Stoli's!!! You certainly have a heart for Cheesesteaks!!went for a steak sandwich while i visited High Tech Hair and found out why everyone loves Philly Cheesteaks.delicious,fresh steak with philly cheese whiz..mmmmmmHave not returned to stolies but as you can see i am beeing harrased by the owner. Apparently the unprofessional idiot thinks im someone else. I have only been to the restaurant once and do not know anyone there. In fact im not even from philadelphia but i am from the streets he so dumb he doesnt even know hes talking to a 1 time customer or that im a young black female and not a man named mike.Tried Stoli's on a Monday around 8pm. We were the only dine it customers. A few people came in to pick up. 
Staff very friendly and interior was clean. Inside there is only counter type seating similar to other cheesesteak places. Stools were a little low for the height of the counter. Napkins right on counter which I liked. 
Got an American without. Steak good size not huge. Good amount of meat. Meat is chopped in medium type of chunks. Not enough cheese and cheese was not distributed evenly. Roll too soft for my liking but it was fresh. Steak seemed a little dry. I added peppers from the pepper bar. 
Huge portion of fries. Got the Cajun which was great seasoning. I prefer thinner cut fries. Some where huge, like a quarter of a potato. Couldn't finish the basket. 
Overall, slightly above average cheesesteak joint but not even the best in the NE. I'd try it again though.Love this spot nothing from here I haven't liked. I just wish the mozzarella sticks were cheesier but other than that can't complain!!!Best cheesesteak in philly by far!! Puts pats Genos and Steve's to shame. Great service and very clean establishment!!The cheesesteaks exceeded my expectations. I went in with the thought they would be decent, but left with no doubts of returning. Had the American whiz with and it was a really good steak. Highly recommend as a Philly Cheesesteak spot.We always order takeout from Stoli's. The steaks are almost perfect! Well seasoned beef - generous portions.  Your choice of a variety of cheeses. Fresh, not canned mushrooms. The rolls are fresh and crisp on the outside, soft and chewy on the inside. The French fries are amazing - steak cut and well seasoned. What made me give 4 stars instead of 5 was this time I ordered a cheesesteak hoagie. I specified raw onions but unfortunately was served sautéed onions. And the lettuce, not crisp iceberg but another unidentifiable type, was placed first in the roll, topped with the cheese, meat, then the fried onions! Needless to say my steak-hoagie had hot, wilted and stringy green slime in it and was less than appealing. If I ever order this again, I'll be sure to request my raw onions and iceberg lettuce "on the side".This was my first time in many years. I seem to have remembered it as being above average. However this recent visit reassured it is very much your standard cheesesteak that you can find anywhere else. 
Note to store owner: HEINZ is the only acceptable ketchup for a cheesesteak. I'm glad i only dipped the corner of my steak ruining just a bite with that garbage Hunt'sI was on travel just north of Philadelphia and am a big believer of when in Rome do as the Romans do.  This place was a real treat.  Very simple place, small, but clean and great food.  I ordered a mushroom cheese steak which was the best lunch I've had in a long time.  The self help bar for pickles, cherry peppers and things like that was a really nice touch.  The cook asked everyone as they left how the food was, which showed he cared.  Now I wished I lived closer as I would be a regular.We had a very pleasant experience. We got a cheesesteak, chicken cheesesteak, and onion rings. Ordered pickup. Woman that took our order was very pleasant. Food was ready in a timely manner. Definitely one of the better cheesesteaks and chicken cheesesteaks in the area. Onion rings were very good also. Would recommend and will order from them anytime I want a cheesesteak.Got a chicken cheesesteak and it had a horrible tasting semi sweet seasoning. Maybe the high ratings come from the beef steak but it was the worse and also very small for the price. I would never return.Cheese steaks were decent as the price wasn't as bad as Steve's but the place could use a cleaning. It wasn't so dirty that would make me leave but it needs some elbow grease.Craving a really good cheese steak so Ordered tonight for the 1st time. Did NOT disappoint!! I had cheez whiz with fried onions. My kids had reg American cheese steaks. Their sandwiches disappeared before I even saw them. Mine was delicious! The steaks are large & loaded with lots of meat. The onion rings were big & crispy & delicious. We love the cheese that comes with the fries. I'll definitely be passing Steve's to order from here again.Cheesesteaks are the signature sandwich for Philadelphia and a tip to not make you look like a tourist straight off the turnip truck, don't call it a Philly cheesesteak in the City of Brotherly Love, just refer to it as a cheesesteak.
There are multiple "celebrity" cheesesteak joints, places that have been immortalized by shows on "The Food Network," "The Teavel Channel," and other television shows, not to mention magazine articles and social media, but honestly, a lot of those places certainly are not the best reflection of the best version of that particular food. In Philadelphia, two places in particular get a lot of attention and the main reason I would suspect is their close proximity to each other and the supposed "rivalry" that they have. I guess they figure it makes for more interesting TV, who knows? 
No, those places don't have the best cheesesteaks, the best cheesesteaks will be found away from the bright lights that the media will light, it will be found in places like this.
Stoli's Steaks (see, no mention of Philly cheesesteak in the name, in fact they are so Philly, they even drop the word "cheese" from the name) is one of those places. Bustleton Avenue is not a place that will have the tourists lining up, but that is their loss. Stoli's Steaks has some great cheesesteaks. In addition to their wonderful cheesesteaks, they have great burgers, big and juicy.
I would also recommend their fries, in particular their pizza fries (truly a Philly culinary wonder). The onion rings are also very good.
I would definitely recommend Stoli's Steaks. Give them a try, you won't be disappointed.Stopped in after being out with friends. Service was fast and the steak was good. I have no complaints, this was just what the doctor ordered after a night out.Great cheesesteak!!  I used to drive 25 minutes to get a good cheesesteak, no longer!  Super glad I discovered this place. The rolls are great and the steak they use (cut in house!!) is DELICIOUS!!  If you're anywhere near the Bustleton & Byberry area you've got to come here! I'm now only driving 5 minutes to get the best cheesesteak in the area.  Heck, I'd even drive 25 minutes for one of Stoli's Steaks!!Awesome Cheese steaks and wings
I ordered through Yelp /grub hub and the food came quickly
Highly recommendThis was my first time here today. I've been waiting to try this place for a while. When you first walk in the place is very clean and the staff was friendly. I believe the owner was there because he said something to the guy on the grill. He told him not to rush and make sure it was perfect. That was great to hear, shows they actually care. At the same time he was talking about having to let someone go. While I didn't mind, thats not a conversation that should take place while customers are around.
Anyway, I ordered a mushroom cheesesteak with fried onions. The wait was a bit longer than what it would be at Steve's but I didn't mind it so much. When I opened the steak I was shocked to see fresh mushrooms. I have to say they were delicious! So much better than the canned that everyone else uses. At the same time I think it can be a double edged sword, I think they took away from the steak. The roll was solid! Perfect chew. The steak itself was good not great. I think it lacked cheese, the cheese was all on top. So when you bit into the bottom part of the roll it was a bit dry. Would have been nice if they mixed the cheese in with the steak. Don't get me wrong it was a solid steak. With a few tweaks I think it could be perfect.
The fries were also very good. They were what you normally get from a steak place. They were seasoned and the portion was huge. I couldn't finish them. We also ordered mozzarella sticks. Considering they used fresh mushrooms I was shocked to see frozen sticks. These were just run of the mill mozzarella sticks you get from a diner. The parking lot is a pain to get out of, it's easier to go out on the Bustleon ave side. The prices were fair.
Overall it was a decent meal. I would probably stop back in, solid 3-4 stars....I'm on a roll! Another cheesesteak spot that is official and well worth the money they're knocking on the door for top five for me. salute to this beautiful Cooper sharp cheesesteakThis is a cheesesteak aficionados cheesesteak.  Roll, meat and cheese is all you need to order.  They do a great job of seasoning the meat.  It is a thicker slice and he purposely does not chop it fine.  There's a couple stools if you want to eat there.  Not much more to say.  This is a very good cheese steak.  Very good corropolese roll.  Very good season meat that you get to bite into.  Good amount of cheese.  You can tell when you are ordering that they are trying very hard to make sure everyone gets a great cheesesteak.  Very good overall experience.Named after the owner's son, this is a great place to get takeout in NE Philly. There are plenty of options, including cheesesteaks, burgers & fries. 
Don't forget to bring cash, since they don't take any cards. And if you plan to pickup your own meal, call the restaurant directly for better prices. (Ordering through the Yelp app will add $).I have been wanting to try this steak place for the past couple years since I heard it moved into our neighborhood, but just haven't had a chance to try it until now. Wish I did sooner, because I was surely missing out on some tasty food.
Ended up ordering from Door Dash on a lazy Thursday evening, when my daughter was craving a cheese steak. Figured this was finally my chance to try this steak shop since Ive been hearing nothing but great things about this place- all those who reviewed it weren't wrong! 
The food was delivered fresh and the cheese steak was long and packed with meat!!!! It was cooked perfectly and was so filling. The meat was overflowing off the bun- and it was definitely worth the price. We also ore red mozzarella sticks, which were also really hot and fresh and tasted good, and we ordered fries with a side of cheese.
I don't know what they season the fries with but they were so good! so crispy and flavorful. The fries tasted like they were just cut from the potato and were so fresh! They were crispy and weren't soaked in grease. I look forward to ordering from here one day soon, cause it was just that good!On a jobsite in the area and had a cheesesteak craving and reviews for Stolis made me have to try it.  Got a simple pizza steak for takeout - overall it was definitely a "philly" quality cheese steak - very tasty!
BUT - and this is an absolute personal preference - I like it when the cheese, sauce, and meat are all mixed together.  It makes a cheese steak easier to eat (less sloppy) and keeps a consistent taste.  Stolis "layers" their pizza steak - so steak, then sauce on top, then cheese melted on top.  Sloppier to eat, and taste is less consistent depending on where you are biting!
I am sure for most people this is a stupid complaint!  I can't even believe I am "analyzing" a cheese steak to this level - but I finally realized this little detail actually makes or breaks a cheese steak for me!Driving through on 276 and looking for cheesesteaks because we never get to Philly on our usual path Ohio to NJ/CT. Stopped because this one was the closest dedicated cheesesteak type shop. In a strip mall, unassuming- just the way I like my places! The cheesesteak was stuffed and you can get it whatever way you like (with pep or without and with mushrooms or without and any cheese that strikes your fancy - I like American or wiz so I got both because, 2021). 
My Ma got a pepper steak with mush and provolone. She loved it! 
I had onions and American+wiz. 
My 1.5 year old had a Nathan's hotdog, which he loved (footlong I think? On the same hoagie type roll, which he also loved!)
The bread is nice bakery bread with seeds. A good solid hoagie roll. Soft inside, slight crisp out. 
Loaded loaded with meat n stuff (stuff being whatever you like on it) - actually enough meat to pay the $10 per sandy.
Would 100% stop again. Delicious! To boot, the guys cooking were super nice.This is the best place in Philadelphia which is making great cheesesteak. I highly recommendedEdit: I came in for the first time In my life even tho I lived in somerton for 20 years and the cheese steak bun smelled like ciggs , owner telling me it's the Uber eats guylmaoHands down the best burger I've ever eaten. I got the diavlo burger and my wife got the southwest burger. Amaze ballsWow! Ordered steaks (5) with family and not only did everyone LOVE them, they were blown away how massive they were! Seeded roll was crunchy yet soft inside... generous amount of American cheese throughout... while the steak (ribeye) itself was cooked to perfection and overflowing out of the roll... Amazing. Met the owner, Nick, who was super cool and grinding away. Thanks! HIGHLY recommend.Absolutely phenomenal. I've lived in Philly my whole life and never even heard of this place. The chef is a great dude and makes a fantastic cheesesteak. Would definitely recommend this placeI've lived one block away from Stoli's my whole life and never visited! Is there a better time to grab a cheesesteak from a local spot than quarantine? So glad I decided against venturing out and driving miles and miles to my favorite cheesesteak spot in the city. Stoli's online ordering through yelp was so easy that it may just become a new habit. Food was still hot, onion rings still crispy, and all of it was delicious!We wanted cheesesteaks and our usual spot was too busy to fill an order so we found Stoli's on DoorDash. I picked up a provolone cheesesteak with pickles and ketchup, Texas Tommy, and chili cheese fries. The steak was much thicker than any cheesesteak I ever had which made it tough to chew. There was so little cheese, I wasn't ever sure it had cheese on it. They forgot my pickles and ketchup. The roll was crunchy and covered in sesame seeds. I wasn't too thrilled with the seeds but it wasn't bad. Texas Tommy was good, it was served on a long roll and it was actually heftier than the cheesesteak. It said it was a Nathan's hot dog but I actually thought it tasted better than Nathan's. Fries were good, not your usual fare, probably pre-seasoned. It seemed like they made a chili cheese sandwich with the fries on the top and bottom as the bun. Portion was huge, twice the size of what you'd get at most other places. Chili was good, a little spicy but not overpoweringly so. I wouldn't call the food bad because it was good but the preparation left something to be desired. If the steak was thinner or chopped smaller and had more cheese (and included my pickles and ketchup), it would have been great. The hot dog was sliced in half leaving parts of the long roll without meat but that's a nitpick over a good sandwich. The naked fries on top of the chili cheese fries would have tasted better with chili and cheese on top of it but I could view that as chili cheese fries with some bonus fries especially given the portion size. Stoli's could easily get 4 stars or perhaps even 5 but the execution hurt it. Of course, this is a Saturday order around dinner time so they were probably slammed so this is likely not an accurate portrayal but it's all I have to judge it by.so expensive！  taste disgusting！just one hamburger one French fries and ten plates chicken wings total $28 ,but $28 not the importance thing. The main point is the wings so dry and the budget same as yesterday.Best burger in the Bustleton Somerton area. Stoli's steakburgers are better than 5Guys, you will be full. Outstanding customer service, I'm disabled and they happily brought my order to my car so I didn't have to walk in. Delicious onion rings, gigantic! They were cooked perfectly, golden and Crispy. If you don't like Stoli's food your doing something wrong.The very best Cheesteaks in philly..i cant emphasize enuf...every bite is like a mini orgasmI ordered lunch from here today based on recommendations from coworkers. I ordered a Chicken Cheesesteak with hot peppers. I get back to my office and took a bite, something didn't taste right. No cheese. Every other aspect seems fine but the absence of cheese means now I have to throw away my lunch and I wasted 9 bucks. Normally I'd take it back but I am at work and can't say I'll miss my 1pm meeting to go back and get another sandwich.All that we tried were the cheesesteaks, but they were incredible. Legitimate good one of the best cheesesteaks. What I don't understand is how a place like this doesn't except debit or credit.My first time at Stoli's. I've been to this physical location many times over the years but it changes hands often and I've found that it has more to do with the location than the food offered by the various store owners who've occupied this space. I had a cheesesteak with onions, green peppers and mushrooms then I added hots. First, the bread: delicious. The bread often makes the sandwich and their choice of Italian hoagie roll is excellent, fresh and delicious. Now the meat: there was A LOT of it. That's good, but not my favorite since it was the minced minute steak type rather than a nice filet Pat's style, which is my preference. Overall though the steak was fine. 4/5 stars. I'm going to come back and try their cheeseburgers. A customer in front of me got three to go and I was watching them being made, they looked great. I'll let you know what I think when I try them. Also it says they serve Nathan's hot dogs which are my favorite sonill have to come back and try those too.Grabbed an Extra American FO late night on my way home from work and it was EXACTLY what I needed! Steak was cooked perfectly, fried onions were super tasty, a generous amount of creamy American cheese throughout... on a soft, seeded roll... excellent! I'd put it up against any of the greats in Philly!The burgers and fries are fantastic! The fries might actually be the best I've ever had. And we saw them cooking a chicken cheesesteak that looked great too. What a find! We'll be back - and this is a place that lunch will cover you for dinner too!I went here 2 times today (on the date of this posting.) first time for me and my sister and the second time because my friend mentioned she's never had a philly cheesesteak!! This spot is LEGITIMATE. I'm proud this was the place I went to instead of going deep in the city for an Authentic Philly Cheesesteak. Big smiles all over the house.
