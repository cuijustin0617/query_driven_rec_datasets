# Gemini-specific prompt with explicit output formatting
UMBRELA_PROMPT = '''
Given a query and a document about a city, provide a score from 0 to 3, where higher scores mean the city is more relevant and helpful for a traveler with this query.

Scoring Guidelines:
0 = The city has little to do with the query.
1 = The city is loosely related to the query, but offers little or no useful information for a traveler.
2 = The city has some relevant features, but they are unclear, not emphasized, or mixed with unrelated details.
3 = The city clearly meets or supports the query goal in a practical or helpful way.

Instructions:
- Assign 3 if the city fulfills the query in any meaningful way, even with extra info.
- Assign 2 if the city shows potential to satisfy the query but lacks key details, or the relevance is partial, vague, or not well-supported.
- Assign 1 if the city is not very helpful for the query.
- Assign 0 only if the city has little relevance to the query.

Query: {query}
City Info: {document}

Split this problem into steps:
Consider the underlying intent of the search.
Measure how well the content matches a likely intent of the query (M).
Measure how trustworthy the passage is (T).
Consider the aspects above and the relative importance of each, and decide on a final score (O). 

Your response must be a single integer between 0-3. Output only the score number and nothing else.
'''

UMBRELA_PROMPT_2 ='''
Given a query and a description of a city, assign a score from 0 to 3 based on how suitable this city is as a travel destination for someone with that interest.
Scoring:
0 = The city is completely unrelated to the query.
1 = The city is weakly related, but is clearly not a good match for what the traveler is looking for.
2 = The city has some relevant aspects, but overall is not a strong or clear match.
3 = The city is a reasonably good or strong match for what the traveler is looking for â€” even if it's only partially relevant.
Important Instructions:
- Assign a score of 3 if the city has any practical or relevant qualities that could make it a suitable destination for the query.
- Assign 1 only if the city clearly does not fit what the traveler likely wants.
- Assign 0 only if the city has nothing to do with the query.
Query: {query}
City Description: {document}
Steps:
- Consider what kind of destination a traveler is seeking from the query.
- Judge how well the city fits that intent or interest.
- Make a final decision.

Your response must be a single integer between 0-3. Output only the score number and nothing else.
'''

UMBRELA_PROMPT_3 = '''
You are tasked with evaluating how suitable **{city}** is as a travel destination for a traveler based on the provided query and city description. Assign a score from **0 to 3** primarily based on your internal knowledge of the city and the supportive evidence from the provided text.

### **Scoring Guidelines:**
- **0** = The city is irrelevant to the query or contradicts the user's intent.  
- **1** = The city is loosely related to the query but provides little value or relevance for the traveler.  
- **2** = The city has some relevant features to the query, but it is not an ideal fit for the traveler's intent.  
- **3** = The city clearly matches the query goal and is highly suitable as a travel destination.  

### **Input:**
- **Query:** {query}  
- **City:** {city}  
- **City Description:** {document}  

### **Evaluation Steps:**
1. Identify the type of destination or experience the traveler seeks based on the query.  
2. Assess the city's overall strength as a travel destination (e.g., general popularity and tourist appeal).  
3. Evaluate how well the city matches the query's intent based on your internal knowledge.  
4. Cross-check the provided city description for supporting details.  
5. Assign a single final score.  

### **Additional Instructions:**
- Be strict in your rating â€” only top-tier cities should receive a score of 3. Most cities should be rated 0 or 1 unless they have clear relevance and strong alignment with the query.  
- Consider the overall popularity of the city as a travel destination â€” some cities have a general popularity advantage over others for most queries.  
- The final score should reflect both the city's specific relevance to the query and its general strength as a travel destination.

Your response must be a single integer between 0-3. Output only the score number and nothing else.
