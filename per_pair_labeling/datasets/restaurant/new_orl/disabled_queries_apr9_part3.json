  "Where can I dine that feels like a hidden part of the city?",
  "Suggest a restaurant where every detail tells a story.",
  "Where can I eat where heritage is innovated on, not lost?",
  "Where can I go where every dish feels crafted with emotion?",
  "What places use food to represent political or social commentary?",
  "Where can I eat with a strong sense of place and story?",
  "Where can I find a place that uses sound and scent in dining?"
