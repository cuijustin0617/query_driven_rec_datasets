UMBRELA_PROMPT = '''
Given a query and a document about a city, provide a score from 0 to 3, where higher scores mean the city is more relevant and helpful for a traveler with this query.

Scoring Guidelines:
0 = The city has little to do with the query.
1 = The city is loosely related to the query, but offers little or no useful information for a traveler.
2 = The city has some relevant features, but they are unclear, not emphasized, or mixed with unrelated details.
3 = The city clearly meets or supports the query goal in a practical or helpful way.

Instructions:
- Assign 3 if the city fulfills the query in any meaningful way, even with extra info.
- Assign 2 if the city shows potential to satisfy the query but lacks key details, or the relevance is partial, vague, or not well-supported.
- Assign 1 if the city is not very helpful for the query.
- Assign 0 only if the city has little relevance to the query.

Query: {query}
City Info: {document}

Split this problem into steps:
Consider the underlying intent of the search.
Measure how well the content matches a likely intent of the query (M).
Measure how trustworthy the passage is (T).
Consider the aspects above and the relative importance of each, and decide on a final score (O). Final score must be an integer value only.

Do not provide any code in result. Provide each score in the format of: ##final score: score without providing any reasoning.
'''

UMBRELA_PROMPT_2 ='''
Given a query and a description of a city, assign a score from 0 to 3 based on how suitable this city is as a travel destination for someone with that interest.
Scoring:
0 = The city is completely unrelated to the query.
1 = The city is weakly related, but is clearly not a good match for what the traveler is looking for.
2 = The city has some relevant aspects, but overall is not a strong or clear match.
3 = The city is a reasonably good or strong match for what the traveler is looking for â€” even if it's only partially relevant.
Important Instructions:
- Assign a score of 3 if the city has any practical or relevant qualities that could make it a suitable destination for the query.
- Assign 1 only if the city clearly does not fit what the traveler likely wants.
- Assign 0 only if the city has nothing to do with the query.
Query: {query}
City Description: {document}
Steps:
- Consider what kind of destination a traveler is seeking from the query.
- Judge how well the city fits that intent or interest.
- Make a final decision.
Final score must be a single integer only.
Output format: ##final score: [score]
