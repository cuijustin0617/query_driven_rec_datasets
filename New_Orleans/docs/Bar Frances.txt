Picky friend and I went the other night and loved it. The food was great and everything we had was delicious. The gnocchi, tomato salad, lamb meatballs - yum!!The food was amazing. I got the lamb shoulder. It was shredded and not on bone like I expected. I hate meat with bones so that was a welcome relief. My friends got the shrimp and polenta and biscuit and chicken. They liked their dishes. The shrimp and polenta was a bit untraditional as we were expecting a shrimp and grits type of sauce. The drinks were great. I had both the brunch punch and mimosa. Not weak at all. Service could have been better. We got the bottomless and it would have been nice to have them coming more frequently. But otherwise everything was great. I'd come back definitely.I've been to Bar Frances quite a few times since they opened. I've had dinner twice and brunch once and then just drinks...
I was actually surprised the first time I came in (opening night!) to see they had a full dinner menu. From the pre-opening information, I thought this was going to be a wine bar with a small selection of snacks. NOPE. Full restaurant. So I sat at the bar and ate...everything that first night and it was delicious! And it's remained delicious each time I've been back. 
LOVE the mushroom toast. Love. It's on Bellegarde bread and is super luscious and savory. I've had a couple of different salads and each has been delicious as have the veg sides (those snap peas are amazing). Loved the avocado toast for brunch (again on the Bellegarde bread). The bartenders make a great old fashioned. I've also had some lovely glasses of bubbles at good prices.
The space is very industrial and they are slowly warming it up. They've added pursehooks at the bar (yay) and some acoustical panels on the ceiling which has helped the volume between my 2nd and 3rd visits. 
Great spot to hang out with friends and enjoy a beverage and some yummy food.What a delight on Ferret! Bar Frances entrances from the decor and staff to MiMi's inspired menu  all the way. We enjoyed the "for the table" and small plates to begin the evening and moved onto entrees... The Saffron Gulf Shrimp and Fish Stew with citrus caramelized fennel, winter squash, cardamon, cilantro and Lebanese flatbread was amazing. Desserts are a specialty and not to be missed.The food is delicious and the service impeccable. The gnocchi is fantastic! I'm going back many, many times.Great new neighborhood gem. Definitely worth the quick Uber ride out of the quarter! Also check out the great wine specials. Rose all dayyyyGreat place for brunch! Bottomless brunch cocktails doesn't hurt as well.... I got the chicken and biscuits and added the fried egg. Definitely will go with poached eggs next time as it was a little dry but still good. Want to come back to try the shrimp and polenta!This is a review of the bar area only, I didn't eat.
We found ourselves here late-ish (11 or so) one night and we were the only people in the place. We sat at the nice bar and chatted for a little while- I had a beer and my date had a cocktail. The atmosphere here is interesting, but I found it a bit cold. The lights were really bright and I guess since we were the only people here we felt a bit out of place. The staff couldn't have been nicer and they didn't rush us out the door, even though there was no one else there. It just felt like I was having a drink after the party had ended and everyone else had gone home.
I think I am going to try to go back again earlier in the evening and get some food there and see if that changes my opinion of the place.Great Happy Hour. definitely get the whipped feta that comes with crostini. It is very smooth almost like hummus consistency. They must cut it with sour cream or something to make it so silky. My sister says that if she were stranded on an island and only had one food it would be their fries with the garlic aioli. Also I got something different as it was catching on  across the bar; an Aperol Spritzer. It went down too fast like drinking kool Aid. It got stuffy and too loud for my sis so we ended up just sharing a those appetizers, but I will definitely be back for the coconut curry mussels!The thing is I can't say much negativity about a happy hour that lasts until 7....but....beyond the drink special this place is not doing it for me. At least do not get the flat bread...I am very confused what their definition of a flat bread is but this was not it. It was doughy and I honestly am not sure what the heck was on top of it. The french fries were all right but I mean they were just french fries....
If you just want an afternoon $6 cocktail on a nice patio that is dog friendly (no outdoor heaters though) and maybe a small snack of some french fries then this place is fine but nothing to write home about.
Would maybe make it a stop before heading somewhere else for an actual meal.We heard great things about Bar Frances from some friends.  We ate dinner there a few nights ago and were disappointed.  Here's the story.
Service:  not good.  Our waitress came up to the table and asked, what do you want to drink.  No introduction.  No welcome.  No hello.  Just straight up, what do you want.  That's ok for some eateries.  I thought BF would be better than that.  Turns out, this was kind of the theme of the dinner.  Seems like the service and food would be good, but they were both subpar.  Our waitress continued to disappoint throughout the night with not checking in, not refilling water, and overall just forgoing basic waitressing stuff.  Bummer.
Menu looked good, but we were pretty consistently underwhelmed with the exception of an endive salad.  That was tasty, simple and fancy looking.  I liked it.  Our pork belly was a total let down.  Shari V had like 3 bites and made it a hard pass.  See her quote below.  It was served with a succotash that looked like it was ketchup based.  Tasted like sriracha but looked like ketchup.  At anyrate, it was neither gustatorily or visually appealing.  Our entree was the Farro Risotto.  It was cooked perfectly.  I would classify the flavor as bland.  So overall, another bust.  We ordered shashito peppers as a starter.  They arrived after the risotto, which was not ideal.  At some point, our order of fries came out.  They were decent but again a little bland.  Served with house aioli, which wasn't good.
Two stars isn't generous for Bar Frances, but it's not harsh either.  The service was bad - not just our waitress, but also how the our courses were paced.  The food was mediocre with the silver lining being a decent endive salad.  Bar Frances has an atmosphere and menu that suggest a nice meal is in the works.  For us, the food and the service were major let downs.  
Shari V Quote:  "This pork belly isn't worth the effort it takes to chew it."Some friends invited me to join them for brunch here last Sunday and I really loved it. The service was friendly and efficient, the space is very nice and not too loud, despite being reasonably crowded and having a concrete floor. 
The food was great. Two of us had the fried chicken eggs benedict, and one had the fried chicken sandwich. All of it was delicious. My only quibbles were that I prefer my eggs a little runny (they were just set) and the brioche used as the base for the benedict was maybe a bit soft. An english muffin works better in my opinion. But these are small quibbles. The hollandaise was good and the fried chicken was amazing. Crispy, delicious coating and very moist. And not expensive.
But the best thing on the table was the absolutely perfect french fries. Wow. Sometimes the simple things show off the kitchen best and in this case that was certainly true. They were crispy and brown on the outside and creamy inside. PERFECT fries.
Our entire bill for three people with three bloody marys came to under $60. Well recommended. I'll be back for dinner.
Update. We went there for New Year's Eve and the experience was horrendous. I couldn't understand how so much could go so wrong, but they ended up comping us the food because the experience was so dreadful. Bad service, messed up food, it was just a shit show. And they were incredibly rude about the reservations and kept calling us to make sure we were going to show up. I get it, it's NYE and you wanna be sure, but calling twice to get a CC #? Really? Who does that? And then throwing us an attitude at the door when they said we had no reservation? Never again.Small plates + wine with vegan options? Of course I'm a fan! My friends and I stopped by on a chill Monday evening recently. It's Carnival season and this was the perfect respite after a boisterous weekend full of parading. 
Service is kind and informed (ie, our waitress immediately pointed out the vegan options and yes, that insanely good mushroom toast is one of them). I was designated driver (imagine?) that evening, so I didn't even look at the wine list, but I'm coming back soon and will report on it with great pleasure. Vegan options include a salad or two, the beet tartare and a cauliflower tagine, which I was a little afraid to order, because I've had terrible versions of that dish one too many times. I went for it and it was not terrible. The cauliflower definitely needed to be less raw, however, and a little more spice would have gone a long way, not to mention a touch more kale, which is my favorite part of this entree. The mint leaves are an extra nice touch! Not sure I'd order it again, if another vegan entree finds its way to the menu. 
The mushroom toast though, lived up to every expectation and more (I can't tell you how many people have told me that I need to get myself to Bar Frances and get that damn toast!) Sometimes mushrooms are chewy, tasteless affairs. These mushrooms are of the perfect texture and cooked expertly. Whatever marinade is on them is perfection and the bread is divine. Need. More.
I'm going back for brunch because if the avocado toast is even half as good as the mushroom toast, I need it in my life on a Sunday afternoon.Such an amazing addition to Freret street! Bar Frances offers both a chic wine bar environment and a super chill balcony experience. There were tons of awesome vegetarian options and the staff were all super attentive and knowledgeable about wine. Everything we tried was amazing: Chenin blanc and Reisling, mushroom toast, beet tartare, gnocchi, and even the bread and butter seemed complex and fabulous. I can't wait to go back and try some of their vegetable plates (super excited about the snap peas with lavender salt).I really want to like this place and I've been three times. The biscuit and jelly is really good. The biscuit and gravy is terribly bland. The worst meal I've had there was dinner. I ordered the steak with chimichurri and fries. The steak was terrible, one of the worst cuts I've had and it wasn't cooked well. The fries were inedible from all of the salt. I struggled with this meal and ended up going home and making a sandwich. For $26 dollars, I'd expect a little better from the steak and fries.Fantastic happy hour! The chicken liver mousse was phenomenal, the olives are perfect, great wine, love it!I had a wonderful evening here with a group of friends. What a great place. Very welcoming and attentive staff. Lovely ambience. Although recently open, I was blown away by the amazing service and the delicious food. Small plates and great wine. Bar Frances will definitely be a go to place.Mediocre all around. Drinks were priced reasonably but nothing to write home about! Very limited food options.Very nice and clean. Very friendly and attentive staff. It's higher end, but we felt welcomed in our casual attire.What a delight on Ferret! Bar Frances entrances from the decor and staff to MiMi's inspired menu  all the way. We enjoyed the "for the table" and small plates to begin the evening and moved onto entrees... The Saffron Gulf Shrimp and Fish Stew with citrus caramelized fennel, winter squash, cardamon, cilantro and Lebanese flatbread was amazing. Desserts are a specialty and not to be missed.First the good points: outstanding wait staff, good cocktails @ reasonable prices, great wine list, reasonable prices for wine by the bottle, had a great bottle of Rose from Loire Valley for around $50, that won't happen @ a Brennan's joint or Besh joint, et al. The Hemingway Daiquiri is great!!  Started out dining in the outside patio area, was a breezy cool night for July (high 70's), that was pleasant, while sipping cocktails reviewing the  menu, when the appetizers came out, we had to move inside, we were invaded by flies, wait staff was very gracious about getting us situated inside & everything moved in an orderly fashion. The issue was the food, nothing there that someone else in town doesn't already offer & prepare better, it didn't wow me. The cheeses on the cheese plate were good, but not much else was offered with it or the charcuterie plate, especially for the price. I don't consider myself a chef or a foodie, but i could have whipped up something at least as good as the entrees, dessert list was kind of boring too, did have a nice pour of Madiera, post dessert. When the waitress asked me how everything was, I didn't have the heart to say,.....meh....because she really did an excellent job. I'd go back to drink & maybe have a snack, but one can do better in terms of an overall meal experience, @ the same price.The atmosphere, food, and cocktails were great! The first time we came a few months ago, I would have given it 2 stars. However, our experience this time was much better. We ordered dinner during their Happy Hour, which is also a great deal. The old fashioned and paloma are highly recommended. I had the burger and my partner has the chicken sandwich. We both highly enjoyed our meal.Kind of a let down. The Pinot noir was served cold and the cheese plate tasted old and dry. The gnocchi was very good though. Way overpriced for what you get.Wine geeks, rejoice. The brand new Bar Frances is the atmosphere and wine list you've been waiting for in New Orleans. Do you love French wine? Of course. Champagne, Burgundy, Loire Valley, Provence, maybe even an occasional Bordeaux? Pretty much everything from France and other important regions is here (other than Oregon Pinot Noir...) with a number of nice glass pours and honestly the glass pricing is amazing. Not cheap mind you, but a really good deal compared to the rest of the U.S. who insists on charging the entire wholesale cost of each bottle for the first glass pour. Not at Bar Frances where the prices are much more "reasonable" for amazing glasses of wine. J. LaSalle Champagne for $16 per glass or $58 per bottle in a restaurant environment? Sign me up! Smaller production, "natural" wines from around the world by the glass for the same price as other restaurants are charging for high volume, generic distributor specials? Awesome.
All the wine is great plus they offer cocktails and some pretty amazing food - generally small plates so if you're looking for a huge meal go elsewhere - in an upscale and refined space in the heart of Freret Street. At least half the food options are vegetarian and a number also appear to be vegan but really the big draw for me is that all food appears to be very good. It's a small kitchen, but they appear to do everything the right way and it's a very smart menu that can be executed quickly. On my first visit less than a week after opening, everything was perfect and service was already running smoothly which is quite a feat. Red Snapper Crudo? Very good. Chicken Liver Mousse? Equally as good. Looking forward to the Beet Tartare, Shaved Summer Squash, Snap Peas, and about a dozen other dishes as well as good cheese and house made charcuterie.
What a great addition to the New Orleans food & wine scene. Woohoo! Truly as good as it gets!This new spot has perhaps the top up and coming chef on NOLA, Mimi Assad.  The happy hour specials are fantastic, particularly the feta and chickpeas.  This is a Desperately needed upgrade on Freret.  You know how I know it's good?  Famous chef Adolpho Garcia was eating here when we were!Ok so first thing first. On a hot diggity  dog day like today it was so refreshing to feel the ac blow high blast in my face as I entered this bar. How cute is this name though "Bar Frances" . Like totally Gr add r A BAD A!!! Lol! Not gonna lie I just walked into this place. I had no idea wht I was getting myself into. I actually thought judging (yes I  did pre judge (  by the outside that it was condos. But to my fortunate luck it was a bar!! TADAHHHH!!! HEAVEN!! THE BARTENDERS HERE are amazing! They know their alcohol.  Lol! I ordered the Hemingway Daiquiri.  The bar manager whipped that bad boy up for me and then the other bartender came over to explain the significance of the drink and the alcohols used to make it. I feel like I got lucky here you guys! A well good daiquiri with some good dawg gone aged rum. How can yah go wrong here for 5 bucks? ?  Craig and Carlos are tremendous!  These guys worked with me babayyyyy in a way I never knew.  They hipped me to what the hell I was actually eating  and drinking! What I like most is that try had so much patience with me and Carlos was very passionate about explaining to me the alcohol that was used in my drink! TALK ABOUT A GREAT HAPPY HOUR EXPERIENCE  !!!!WOOOOOHHHH!!!!!! I EVEN ORDERED CHEESE! LOL!!! It's called "Comte 16 month" for 4 bucks! Amazing! Nice and creamy! The cheese is so good yall!!! I  Will be back!!!!Dreadful. Overpriced. Poor and awkward service. Went with some friends for a few cocktails. Left after a single round thanks to a scattered and confusing series of events. Ordered an Oberon (listed on the menu at 5 bucks) and received mayyyybe a half pint of Ommegang. When I told the waitress that I hadn't got what I'd ordered, she told me they didn't have Oberon and that I had confused her. [Turns out they have a different Bell's beer, despite the menu].
So I got charged more (6 bucks) for a beer I didn't order. Also, the skimpiest sixteen dollar cheese plate I've ever seen. On a street with very strong options [Cure! Ancora! Company Burger!], Bar Frances delivers the feeling of getting ripped off by a calculating force.
I get it: they're ironing out the kinks. But the only folks who are going to be fooled by this place are folks I don't want in my neighborhood.My husband and I dined here for New Year's Eve. We had the four course meal with wine pairing. If we are ever back in the area we will revisit this little gem. Excellent service as well.Great food! We sat at the bar and ordered almost everything on the menu! My favorites were the lamb meatballs and pork shoulder. The food was delivered fast, so we could continue to order throughout the night without a long pause. The service was perfect, very friendly. 
I really enjoyed their lighter offerings as well: farro salad, cauliflower tergine. The flavors were bright! 
Will definitely be back.We had a fantastic dinner at Bar Frances!  My family and friends were in town for Memorial day weekend so it was a large party with very diverse food interests and everyone loved it.  The food is well balanced - very fresh and layered. The waitstaff were very knowledgeable and answered our multiple questions.  We ate tapas style - the gnocchi, beet tartare, mushroom toast, pork belly, snap peas and Hangar steak were stand outs.  The wine list is very impressive and well curated.  We sat inside but the outside seating is a great addition to Freret street.  Overall, highly recommend and a great addition to New Orleans.After a lovely early evening of cocktails and small plates at the bar, the host asked us if we were ready to leave because someone else wanted our seats. Really?! The 3 of us just dropped $100+ on cocktails and small plates and you want us to leave? Ridiculous. This place has potential but the manners and mentality are way below what I would expect from a new place that is looking to gain new customers. Sorry, but you lost my business simply based on not appreciating my business.Delicious glass of (actual) champagne for just $16, lovely chocolate cremeaux w/ bitter orange marmalade for dessert. Affordable BTG wines from barrels/kegs. Ask to sit in Jessie's section! She's super knowledgeable and enthusiastic about wine.Incredible wine selection, outstanding service, and even better food. I have been here several times and it is one of my favorite spots in the city. Great happy hour!!!My boyfriend and I went here for our New Year's Eve dinner. While we waited for our table they went ahead and started us at the bar for a glass of sparkling wine. They continued to make sure we were okay, but the wait was really only due to the fact that we were early for our reservation. I wish I remembered our servers name because she was so great. The service here is honestly fantastic. The scallops were by far the best thing we had although the pompano was delicious as well - with extra crispy* skin!Went to Bar Frances tonight and had a lovely time.  We first walked in it was a little loud but nothing to complain about.  After about 5 minutes a great waitress came and started helping us.  we ordered both the meat and cheese plates,  the salami and pork were my favorites and the sophia cheese was delicious.  Then for the main meal we split many small plates, the beet tartare was good, the mushroom toast was good aswell but slightly blackened, the gnocchi was devine and by far my favorite was the red snapper and the snap peas.  Then we finished the meal with grilled peaches (Delicious) and balsamic strawberries (HEAVENLY the best part was the meringue) DEFINITELY WILL BE BACKCute bar and restaurant with good vegan options amongst other meat and vegetarian ones. The menu was small but thoughtful. I had the cauliflower tagine (vegan ) and the flavors were top notch. My partner enjoyed the lamb meatballs thoroughly. 
Friends dining with us had been there before and said the olives used to be better- in the past castelverano but these were small and not quite as good, so check on type if you are picky about olives. 
Drinks delicious and we were happy to take advantage of a Thursday special with half off bottles of sparkling wine. 
Ambiance has dim lighting and soft ambient sound so would be good for a chat where you actually want to hear someone (date , catch up with friends). You can also sit at the bar. 
Overall, a special classy yet understated place to eat in the wonderful city of New Orleans!First time here & I loved everything. I had the Niçoise salad, fries with aioli, & a French 75 out on the patio. Food was seasoned perfectly, quite possibly the best fries I've ever had.We had an amazing meal here on a Sunday night.  Wonderful fish, a wide variety of vegetarian options, inventive cocktails and great wine list. Amazing gnocchi!The food was pretty good with an interesting selection of small plates. Not too impressed with entrees (basic pork chops, chicken, fish). The host was kind of rude. I asked for a booth in an empty restaurant (he said yes) and then proceeded to show us to a table in the middle of the restaurant. I said "well that's not a booth". He rolled his eyes and then showed us to a booth near the host stand. I overheard him turn away several customers saying they were booked but the restaurant was empty for the first hour we were there (6-7). Thought that was kinda weird.Hard to say what we liked best-everything was that good. With small plates it is easy to share several things. Standouts included the chicken liver mousse, roasted oysters, lamb meatballs and best ever french fries! The chocolate dessert was a killer. Can't wait to go back!We ate here for dinner last night and we weren't that impressed. 
The service was excellent so I give them 4 stars for that. 
We waited for the rest of our friends and sat at the bar we ordered the French fries which were delicious with the Aiolli sauce! 
My boyfriend ordered a beer that was 9 ounces and 9$ way overpriced. We ordered the steak which was way overcooked for asked to be prepared medium. The mussels didn't have much flavor. If I ever went back the PORK CHOP WAS DELICIOUS I would order that. We ordered the cheese plate and for some reason the brie cheese tasted like broccoli.... weird.  But anyways, not that impressed probably won't return.The place is a bit cold, very open, very loud and too bright. No ambiance whatsoever! Wine list was good but overpriced and weak pours. I would rate the food about the same. We ordered one of almost everything on the menu, both small plates and entrees. 
Most things, with the exception of the snapper crudo which had pieces that tasted rotten and the pork belly which was not seasoned at all and had a Caribbean type of flavor that just did not go with the dish, were very tasty. Portions were extremely small for the price. In my experience if you order a pate that comes on toast already, it should be served with a portion for each customer. This had two small pieces of bread with a scant portion of pate, sharing was very akward as you have to touch the bread to tear apart for each person to try. 
This was not a place I would be interested in frequenting again for dinner unless some tweaks were made with both wine and food portions for the prices they are charging.This place has one of my favorite dishes I've eaten in the city: Mussels in a pistachio dill sauce that comes topped with potato chips. That alone is worth going in for - and it's on their happy hour menu! I haven't tried the entrees, only apps and soups - but everything has been great. Bartenders are super friendly - great place to go sit at the bar solo if you just want to chill.No. I wish yelp let you leave one word reviews because it would be just NO. I came here starving and still couldn't honestly say I enjoyed any of the food. My entire table would agree. The 2nd star is for my drink, I can appreciate a well made old fashioned. But the food though... whatever you do don't get the $16 bowl of ew and raw eggplant (risotto)... my first few bites were pure salt followed by a sudden flavor void so im pretty sure chef forgot to season it and just threw some salt on the plate after (i hope that is not how the recipe is bcz gtfo new orleans if so). I'm no food critic but this was an exceptionally terrible meal and the service is seriously lacking. the French fries were good lol.Very trendy decor & atmosphere with unique, exciting menu options for both food and wine. I've recently discovered Chenin Blanc white wines and the one we ordered was perfect for the hot summer night. For appetizers, the Red Snapper Crudo was light and citrusy and the Mushroom Toast was savory and hearty. For our meal, we shared the Grilled Gulf Fish which came with this awesome pesto sauce and was cooked very nicely. Only negatives were that the waitress didn't really elaborate much on the dishes (but the place is still so new which could be why) and it's very loud within the restaurant making it a little hard to hear. Overall though we had a great experience and I would definitely recommend this place to my friends.I went here for dinner and ordered the only vegetarian entree, stuffed squash blossoms, with a glass of sherry and warm olives as a starter. The delicate squash blossoms were quite special and worth the expense. The wine was good but over-priced. The olives were plentiful, but there was only one kind. Since I love any kind of olive, this didn't bother me, but some people might prefer a variety. We enjoyed the outside seating, and the service was friendly.
It's pricey, but I would definitely go back here for dinner for a special occasion. I also really want to go back and try happy hour and mushroom toast.Great food, decor, atmosphere and service!! Had brunch on a Sunday .  Highly recommend !! Spread the word!! They have only been open for 3  months .Good happy hour, especially if you are willing to try their house wines. I tried the rillettes, which were satisfactory, and their fries are really good too. 
Good to have it available by my job so I can pop in after work. :)Bar Frances might be characterized as a Bistro I guess. Often, at Bistros, they are FADS (With big nicely decorated plates with a dollop of food in the center:)because NO Restaurants must have a local following. This restaurant is simplistically elegant. The service is A+. The owner seems to be there often which is indicative of attention to detail and Bar Frances blows the doors off when it comes to that. The Charcuterie Plates(I get both. Meat AND Cheese are often made right there!! The "bread" is ridiculously perfect for Charcuterie). 
Had the Hanger Steak about 5 times. The Pommes Frites are great, but I'm a low carb guy and they've made me some very creative veggies with just olive oil and garlic.
Just tried Pork Chop. Outstanding. Wife likes salads and mussels as well as a nicely prepared chicken. Hanger Steal remains # 1 with a star for both of us, but it's ALL good!!
This place is one of the best restaurants in town IMO!!!Excellent spot for brunch on a Sunday. The restaurant was not particularly packed when my girlfriend and I visited, so our reservations in advance were unnecessary. The staff was friendly, informative, and helpful. The curried butternut squash was scrumptious, and the fried chicken sandwich was delicious and appropriately messy. The fries with the sandwich were pretty good as well. Overall, a great spot for brunch.was super excited to try this place until I smelled and saw their fish purveyor transporting old fish from ice chests in his truck bed to the restaurant. None of the ice chests had ice hence why the stench was so pronounced. I've heard the waiters are incompetent esp the one with the egg head. Maybe if they get some fresh blood and fresh ingredients I'll check it outHubby and I tried this place last week while bar hopping down freret. Cool atmosphere. We sat outside and they are dog friendly. Hanger steak was delicious with a nice crisp on the outside. Garlic aioli totally made the meal. Portions are a bit small for the price tag especially the same dish at other restaurants. Hubby liked the drinks but sadly can't remember what he got. May come back for drinks but will probably skip the food unless they rethink the portion sizesRecently went to lunch at Bar Frances. It is a beautiful environment ! Great décor!  The  food is FABULOUS! Everyone at our table had something different and all were delicious! 
Wonderful wine selection.
There were many choices for lunch. The staff were very professional with great service.
Can't wait to go back for dinner.
This is definitely the PLACE to go to in  New Orleans.Portions sizes are small, and prices are high, even for a tapas restaurant.  Red snapper crudo was absolutely drowned in lemon and still managed to taste fishy.  Similar flavor and problems with the scallop crudo.  Gnocchi was adequately flavored, but the texture was an awful mush.  Restaurant was astoundingly loud, even at half full.  You could have a world-beating meal for a comparable price at Shaya, or, really, anywhere.Such a great brunch! I went with a party of 5 for  a friends birthday celebration and couldn't have been happier! Delicious everything! Great service! Great atmosphere! Closest thing to a New York brunch experience that I've had in New Orleans. And that's a good thing! We will definitely be going back!Wife and I didn't realize they were open for brunch and, through a series of events, happened to see someone setting chairs up right before 10 am! We were welcomed inside right away. Our waitress was wonderful. She was upbeat and helpful with food and drink selections! The grapefruit/champagne drink was excellent, as was the boozy lemonade. They had fancier names but I can't remember what they were . The avocado toast and chicken biscuit (again, had fancier name but I don't remember it) were excellent. I can't wait to go back!Before yesterday, I'd only been to Bar Frances for Happy Hour and always sat outside on the porch which is covered so you sit there rain or shine. The drinks have always been good, and it's one of the only Happy Hours I can make it to as it goes till 7. A thank you, for being a restaurant/bar that caters towards the New Orleans Professionals who can't make it to the 3-5 or 4-6 happy hours. 
I finally made it to brunch here after another spot was too crowded and expected a 30 min wait. I was too hungry to wait so my friend and I came here. They have a small brunch menu and also offer their lunch choices as well. My friend got the burger with added bacon and I got the buttermilk biscuit with bacon gravy and friend chicken. IT WAS SO GOOD. Highly recommend. Their drink prices for brunch are also reasonable. 16$ for bottomless brunch drinks, or in my friend and I's case we had a mimosa at 5$. I'm not sure why this place wasn't more crowded it is definitely a brunch place I will be coming to again.
One thing: it was a bit stuffy/hot inside. If they had a ceiling fan, it would have made a huge difference. It wasn't super super hot yesterday but I did feel a bit sticky while inside. I don't know how that would be with a ton of people inside or on a hotter New Orleans day. 
Overall: Try Bar Frances out! It's super good, and you won't regret it.I've been here more than a few times and each time I've had the tuna Niçoise salad -- it's great.  I recently reached out to BF to bring a couple dozen guests to have brunch after a graduation.  Initially BF, specifically Mark, was responsive.  My preference would have been for my guests to order whatever they wanted (the menu is quite limited), but in order to accommodate my party, I had to select 3 entrees (understood).  Of the 3 items I selected, the highest was priced at $17.  With a undesirable selection of appetizers and unwanted deserts, they wanted $30 per guests.  I shared that appetizers weren't really appealing and didn't need desert and asked to do something different.  Silence! There's a lot of needs during graduation season, but to ghost a former customer (will not spend another dime there and will not recommend it anymore) who's trying to plan a celebration for their child's milestone is not cool and is terrible customer service.  A "we can no longer accommodate your request, sorry not sorry" would have gotten them 4 Stars!
#neveragainThis place is usually great but the other night my wife and I went here and it was very, very busy. I think the restaurant was under staffed because it took forever to order, didn't get our drinks until half way through the meal and the food missed the mark. I'll go back again, but this time they goofed.what's up my PEOPLE. so this place is my home. we are frequent flyers at this place. great food, great atmosphere, overall huuge fan. the brunch here does us dirty.  only complaint is the wait is a bit out of hand, but we cope. 9/10 recommend and y'all know we be rolling back upChicken liver mouse was amazing.  Great wine list.   Also recommend mushroom toast and beet tartar.My new favorite. Wonderful happy hour, fabulous lunch, dinner and brunch!! Highly recommend just about everything!! Nice service, ambiance and general all round deliciousness. My only concern is that it's going to become too popular. Sigh.Aperol Spritz is my favorite drink and hard to find. I will be back. Bar foods during Happy Hour were excellent. Staff was very enjoyable and knowledgeable and sweet!!I was very excited to hear about this new bar/restaurant but was severely disappointed with every aspect of our evening. We came in to have a drink, appetizer, and entrees. The wine selection was more than adequate, but we waited over 20 minutes for our appetizer gnocchi which when it was arrived was thoroughly burned. My partner and I rarely (if ever) send back dishes because we both work in the restaurant industry, but the long wait on top of an inedible burned gnocchi was too much. Our entrees arrived after another 15 minutes or so (for an med rare steak and duck). They were better than the appetizer, but the steak was quite salty and the duck entree wasn't cohesive. Although the service was the least problematic aspect of this place, the service clearly had issues. The server, while friendly, did not know the scallop special that she stated was on the menu, and did not present proper knifes for our entrees (steak was given with a butter knife). I always love to give new places a try and I wouldn't feel as strongly about this establishment if it wasn't for the fact that there was no manager present to address the issues we had. We returned an item and the manager did not once touch the table to address our concerns. While I appreciate them comping our drink, acknowledgement of the concerns we had by a manager would have gone a lot further in our impression for the growth of this company.My friend and I had a wonderful time sipping wine on the patio. It was a hot summer night but the working fan made us feel very comfortable. We had a delicious and an inexpensive bottle of Riesling and a few small plates for sharing. We started with the saucisson sec, one of the best I've ever had and I am French (and ironically I was told it was made in the US) LOL, the Comte, the delicious and light Chichigo peppers ( I don't know where the name comes from), and the Champagne salad. A delicious and refreshing mix of greens that was complementing the charcuterie. and gave us the illusion that we were eating only healthy. The illusion disappeared pretty quickly once we ordered our French fries/Aioli ( garlic is an antioxidant, so it's not that bad;) We ended our dinner on a sweet note with grilled peaches and Champagne.Well I love wine .... And any new bar that focuses on wine definitely gets my attention. But... I wasn't excited about this place unfortunately!  I'm sure the actual wine lists/cocktail lists etc are perfectly fine. I had a delicious glass of red that my hubby chose for me. My big beef with this place is the ambiance(or lack of). For starters ... Once we were walking up we were hoping to score an outdoor table because the night was pleasant. Well... There were seats available but holy cow the damn wattage from the lighting made me squint!!! Whatever happened to low level lighting or candles??? We then ventured inside and the sound was deafening. Big Sigh... I love the pretty modern interior.. But concrete,windows and drywall do not a comfortable conversation level make. With nothing  to dampen the sound it was pretty uncomfortable. We ran into friends and basically were yelling to each other to be heard over the underlying din.  I'm hopeful that maybe something will change- even if it's just lowering the brightness of the patio lights!I went here expecting a cute wine bar with some good solid food. Unfortunately, when we arrived the lighting was very bright and it felt like a lunch spot. We ordered our food and although the service was great, nothing was seasoned and all the veggies tasted to be steamed with no flavor whatsoever. We ordered a steak medium rare that came out basically raw. I would recommend this place for someone who wants wine and a snack but not a meal.Delicious.  Shrimp and avocado small plate was excellent, as was the Burger.  And both cocktails were well prepared. Service was excellent. Would definitely come backFood was cooked well, but everything has a strong charcoal taste. We ordered the fish and the steak. Both had the same dominating charcoal taste with the texture of the fish or steak. Our entire table commented on how our entrees had an overwhelming charcoal 'flavor' which didn't allow you to actually taste the meal you were eating.
Prices do not reflect the meal. If you're into licking a piece of charcoal and then eating some decently cooked steak for $25... You'll love it!
Additionally, and more noticeably to everyone, the acoustics in the place are horrendous. With a server standing next to us, we could barely hear a word or make out what was being said. Table discussions were difficult and unpleasant. Sound is bouncing all around that room from every conversation in the entire place, the music was off because it would just add to the roaring noise in the place.
It was a relief to leave and give our ears a rest.I came back again on a Tuesday evening with a friend and we sat at the bar. The food was delicious (I forgot to take pictures it was so good). Even thought the restaurant was busy for a Tuesday evening, I found myself able to have a conversation with my friend and actually hear her! The wine choices were decent, but I'd probably opt for a cocktail next time since those looked so delicious. The mussels are so good and so is their cheese plate! Would highly recommend both. They run a great happy hour as well, and it goes until 7pm! There's also outdoor seating for those nice days when you don't want to be limited to sitting indoors.Really unfortunate because my wife and I had been before and loved it. They might have been having an "off" night, but had the worst service maybe ever - water was never refilled entire meal and didn't see server after ordering (had to get up and ask her to bring the bill). Food was incredibly over salted. Too many choices in this city - not going back. SorryAs a Freret neighbor, I love this place! Really. Never disappointed with the food or wine selection. HOWEVER, tonight I was highly disappointed that they took off the scallop & pork belly entree. Probably the best thing they have ever served! This city has some good scallop dishes BUT always with a beurre blanc (so over done)...this place did such a different sauce & did I mention pork belly??? Please oh please bring it back!I came here for brunch with a group of friends. Not going to lie, we were mainly motivated by the $16 unlimited cocktail menu. The cocktails were great and the food was delicious, too. I made our reservation for 6 people, but we had a last minute addition to our group and they were easily able to accommodate us.  We sat and talked way beyond our meal and paying the bill and we felt rushed to leave in no way. Can't wait to go back!Great happy hour! Appetizers, cocktails, wine, and beer are all on the happy hour menu. I had the Sazerac, shishito peppers and whipped feta. Solid dishes. Good service.So good! Love the atmosphere, service is great and the food is fantastic. I don't usually like restaurant bars but I love the ambience. It's contemporary and laid back which is definitely my thing. Food and drinks come out quick. I highly recommend this cute little spot if you're in the area!Bar Frances totally nailed brunch. Everything from the whipped feta appetizer to the pork belly and egg sandwich (and fries) were amazing. To top it off, the rose and grapefruit drink was super refreshing and exactly the twist on a brunch drink that I needed! A perfect low key brunch spot.We were the first to walk through the door of the long awaited Bar Frances.  We were greeted immediately by the courteous and attentive staff.  I usually won't visit a new restaurant for the first six months- LOL, but Bar Frances delivered all things essential ON the FIRST Night!  The Ambiance is delightful, the small plates were superb!  Must Haves:  Pate plate of 3 *****, Mushroom toast *****, beets tartare with sweet potato chips! *****, Veggies with Pesto *****.  It was all outstanding.  We'll definitely be back.  Lots of outdoor seating in a lovely setting.  My only criticism is that they should've opened a long time ago.. Just what Freret needed.Fantastic happy hour, thoroughly enjoyed the House champagne and charcuterie and cheese boards. The space was small but cozy, minimally but well decorated. Would have loved to sit outside and will do so if I visit again in cooler months. Could definitely see myself making this a regular stop. Love the extended happy hour (4-7 except for Thursday and the weekend) and it seems like they do great brunch so will visit again soon for thatOur group came in for brunch -- the avocado toast was a group favorite and I loved the rose grapefruit cocktail.Off the charts great.
We stopped in for happy hour, had mussels, fried chickpeas, and some awesome shrimp rigatoni. Ordered extra bread to soak up all the amazing sauces.
