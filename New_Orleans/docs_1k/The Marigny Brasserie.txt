Ordered the crawfish marigny...needs more flavor. At least some salt and black pepper. Drinks were good though.The gumbo was really good, with some blues music to maintain a easy attitude.  Great place to have a drink or twoJust a great place to go. Food was very good both times we went there. Camille was a great waitress and the band was a lot of fun. This place is a great find and was not very hard to get a table.The bbq shrimp with grits are amazing. The hamburger is huge and great! Server is super nice. Live jazz music is great. Truffle fries are mouth wateringMarigny Brasserie Unsanitary Practice
We were regulars here until wife got ill immediately after a burger.  
We ignored this at first, until I noticed very unsanitary practices on a subsequent visit.
I e-mailled the manager, describing exactly what I had witnessed; but no response.
We have quit going here and suggest others be very careful, too.
This is a shame, as this was otherwise a very good place.
I am not a "clean freak"; but am a physician.  
What I witnessed was terribly unsanitary, too.  Not just something minor.
I sincerely hope that this will be corrected soon.  As I told the manager, we would like to be able go back to this place with some confidence.Absolutely fabulous! The host was so extremely helpful and polite. We were there for halloween and no one was stressed. The gumbo was fabulous and nice and spicy, the atmosphere was classy but well decorated for halloween. The band was great, the temperature with doors open was very nice. We had the burger, regular burger. Couldn't even fit the darn thing in my mouth it was so big. Loved the big fat tomato on there as well! Loved it, would go back in a heartbeat!!Honestly, one of the worst restaurants I've ever been to. I am from New Orleans and this restaurant is a weak attempt of new orleans food. Service was not bad but everything I had was meek  or bad.  The service was not bad . The waitress was very kind. The bathroom was awfully dirty. DISGUSTING. 
Oysters were served room temperature borderline hot. 
Even after the voucher, we still paid $60. Incredibly overpriced for such bad food. It really seemed like it was someone from out of town trying to be a hip nola restaurant on frenchmen. Maybe if you didn't know any better (aka not from new orleans) you would like the food was good. My advice for locals and anyone really is Don't try this place.We went for lunch.  Do not get the frog legs.  Unfortunately, the chef covered the frog legs in a THICK, GREASY batter.  We were not able to find any meat on the frog legs underneath the batter.
The gumbo was decent, not the best ever, but a nice collection of spices.  If I have to eat here again, this is what I would order.Food OK but priced a little high for the quality. Worst part was the SERVICE!  And honestly don't think it was the fault of the wait staff...they were obviously working their butts off to keep up with a less than full house.... bussing, serving, waiting tables, etc. The hostess had to bring us a cocktail after waiting 15 minutes for it... management of this establishment needs to get organized and hire more staff.Service sucks, 30 minutes with no waiter or drink. We were asked to tip the band (which we did) but then we left without being served anything.Horrible. Greasy overdone steak.  Bugs on plates.  Slow service.  Nothing redeeming about this place.I am not quite sure why this place is considered inconsistent. We had two of the best meals in New Orleans here, almost two weeks apart. The meals were nearly perfect, wonderful fresh salads, crabcakes and fantastic well-priced libations. When drinks in Los Angeles are $10-12, $7 is a bargain.
Service was very good, which we find always a huge notch above the service in Los Angeles. There aren't a bunch of waiter/actors in NOLA.
Since we were staying nearby, it was a nice walk and we were not rushed through our meals, making both meals extremely pleasant and relaxing. The atmosphere is quiet and relaxing, in the off times when there is no live music.
We will visit this place the next time we are in New Orleans.Fun atmosphere with a live band. Just stopped in for an appetizer and drinks not disappointed and would definitely recommend if you're close by.This place has so much potential, but we had a really mixed experience.
Great atmosphere. Great neighborhood with some neat jazz bars a couple doors down.
Service was bad--we had a large group, and our single waiter didn't handle it well.
The drinks were good. I had a pisco sour that was mixed as a martini. Possibly sacriligious to drink it this way, but I liked it.
The food was disappointingly hit/miss. The spring salad was bland. The escargot was creative and tasty. The pork cheeks were awesome. We ordered the crawfish ravioli based on Yelp reviewers, but it was BAD. It was waaaay too salty. I get that we're in NoLa, but it was twice as salty as my pork cheeks and borderline unedible. That was just typical of our meal.
Great potential, but just not a thoroughly good experience. Worth a try, but have guarded expectations.Our first meal on our first night in NOLA. She had the fish special (some sort of Gulf fish?) and I had the crawfish pasta. All well prepared and served with excellent service. A restaurant we'd happily go back to.We chose this restaurant because we wanted to see live music while we ate. I was a bit disappointed to be seated in a room where I could hear, but not see, the singer/guitar player. (There were only barstool-height tables in the stage area, no unoccupied regular tables.) The gumbo was excellent and our server was warm and hospitable--which I find is pretty much the norm in New Orleans. Folks seem to glad you're there! Keep the good times rolling!!Friendly service and pretty good food. My favorite part of the meal was my cocktail, Momma's Moonshine, yum. They also had live music while we ate. I'd definitely come back for drinksI really really enjoyed everything about this. The band playing was great, the atmosphere was fun and the restaurant was clean. I had the roast beef po'boy with mashed potatoes based on our waitress's recommendation. It was phenomenal! Super tender roast beef with crispy bread. My dining mate had the red beans and rice which was also phenomenal. 
Our waitress was great and super friendly. The atmosphere is great and overall the best place on Frenchmen Street. The bathrooms were very clean also. If there was more room in my stomach I would have tried dessert!This place is not your typical New Orleans bar. In fact, it's mainly a restaurant. But that didn't change anything. The music, on this night played by the fantastic Shotgun Jazz Band, was perfect accompanying the great cocktails prepared here. Cucumber Collins, the housemade bread pudding, and great jazz music = a successful evening.
Highly recommend enjoying an evening at Marigny Brasserie.Just stopped in for a few brews while on vacation. They have a huge screen projector to watch games on, however, the seating wasn't ideal for hanging out. Go there to eat (no idea how the food is)...it was packed when we went.Still delicious this time had the BBQ shrimp and grits. The greens served with this are BRILLIANT! The shrimp were cooked to perfection and the sauce was a smoky, rich reduction type that was very good. He had the trio and said it was awesome , this I now on my "must visit" list in NOLAI had been to NOLA two times before this trip and wanted to try something off the beaten path. I searched and came across this restaurant. Another plus was it was on  Frenchmen street, where the locals flock to to hear live music and no cover at most places.
The menu prices were reasonable and the food tasted like home cookin! For dinner I ordered the grilled andouille sausage and red beans with rice. They were out of the collard greens, as the crowds from Mardi Gras goobled them up the day before! I ended up getting the grilled green beans with a garlic butter sauce, it was a $15 plate, but was amazing!!! My boyfriend ordered the grilled gator and andouille sausage with fresh grilled veggies and the same grilled green beans. His plate was a $15 meal as well, but he loved it!!
Our server was very nice and made a few suggestions and even told us a bit about the neighborhood and restaurant. He even recommended a few places to visit we had not visited on our previous trips.
The only downside to the restaurant is that we choose to walk from our hotel on Poydras and Camp. It was a bit far, but do-able, as we walked straight down Bourbon St. We enjoyed this restaurant and will mark this on our places to visit again!Great music ! However food is good , expensive and overall not worth it ! 
Enjoyed the music ! But eating was very expensive .Walked in on a Monday night looking for some live music and Marigny didn't disappoint. Abby the bartender was awesome! Try a Southern Bella or a Mojito. The huge chicken quesadilla and crawfish fritters were delicious. Jon Roniger and the Good for Nothin' Band played cool original music. I will definitely come back the next time I'm in NOLA.The service was horrible, very slow and nom attentive.  Food was ok at best. Music very loud made it impossible to have conversation at table. I would not recommned.I've had fantastic and just mediocre experiences here, so I'm giving it three stars as an average.
Ive had food here that was delicious, rich, full of flavor, and well cooked. The bad experience (blah food) happened on Halloween night, so perhaps they were just overwhelmed with the crowds? Still, it was enough to disappoint.
Great cocktails. If you wander in from the street, it's a nice place to have a stiff drink and sit in air conditioned comfort.Great place tucked away in the French Quarter. Good service and great live music. Everyone was so friendly. The blackened redfish is a must.This place is my absolute favorite in the city. I ate here when I was visiting and now since moving here I eat here all the time. Their food is amazing at such a great price. I am a huge fan of their sandwiches I have tried them all, the roast beef poboys and the wild boar are the best. The gumbo is the absolute best in the city, I have tried to imitate the recipe but there is something special about it. The oyster shooters are also so good, although I hate paying 9$ for them they are worth it. Fried pickles are also great. 
Be careful what night you go. They usually have live music on the weekends and it is so loud you can't have a conversation or even hear yourself think. Most of the times I have been there I've had the same waitress. She always seems like she's in a bad mood or doesn't want to be there and I constantly have to ask for water and silverware but besides that this restaurant is epic!Nice atmosphere n scenery but food not so well.
Ordered an app that was burned in old grease n had to be remade so it took twice as long to come out . 
Entree finally came out pasta was bland n my steak was medium rare when I wanted medium well , YUCK 
And note we are the only guest n we've been here for almost an hr and I still haven't gotten my food corrected . Waiting on a simple burger now since they couldn't correct my steak . 
No recommendations from me1st and most importantly we enjoyed our brunch and the buttered rum coffee.
Came in for brunch and were promptly seated and received great service. It did appear though soon that the front of the house was understaffed. With seats remaining they began turning people away, lots of people, while still having the capacity to take them. Our server became more unavailable as she was trying to keep the place together. Bouncing between all the tables, the kitchen, and rejecting confused groups of elderly people. Then I see the chef come out and start rejecting people at the door saying the kitchen was way backed up and they couldn't seat any more people. If the kitchen is backed up shouldn't the chef be in the kitchen? I don't know what was going on, a bit bazaar but other than taking a while to get our check to leave I am not dissatisfied.My service was great! My food was great. Not really sure what everyone is complaining about. Huge portions and definitely the best wings I have ever had. I live around the corner and will definitely go back!Friendly service, loud jazz, good drinks, and a fast kitchen.
We really enjoyed our first night meal here. The drinks were nice, well made and not too expensive ($7 to $9). The Southern Bella was like a sweeter Manhattan. The Sazerac was clasically made. 
We had the fried green tomatoes, and the remoulade was creamy and spicy. Our friends had the Oyster Shooters and loved them. 
The food came so quickly, which was great, since we were very hungry!  The red beans and rice was very nice, the blackened redfish was was excellent, and our friends enjoyed the seafood platter. 
This was a good choice for dinner!This restaurant located on Frenchmen Street gets rave reviews for the food, drink and live music, but the waitress left a lot to be desired. She talked way to fast, was inattentive due to the fact that she was managing tables inside and out and she got flustered way too easily. If it weren't for the food and music I don't know that I would go back.Stumbled upon this little gem while trying to find sustenance & libations away from the crowds at French Quarter Fest. This place offered a Cool vibe, great drinks & savory meals. We started with Lavendar Champagne & Fried Pickles then opted to split the Frenchman Poor Boy with homemade real potato fries & a cup of Louisiana Gumbo. Great venue with live music & chill atmosphere and yummy food!This is probably the most upscale looking place on Frenchmen Street. We had lunch here. The food was OK, not outstanding. Pleasant enough but when you can pay just as much for lunch a Commander's Palace and have 25 cent martinis at the same time...
Probably a better place to grab brunch with friends in the neighborhood or to stop and have dinner on the way to listening to some music at Snug Harbor in the same block.Wanted to like this spot but I was unimpressed. Came with a group of 8 for brunch, so yes, we were a big group, but service was suuuuuper slow, and food was only ok. In a neighborhood with so many gems, this is a spot to skip.
The good:
- My cucumber basil lemonade was delicious. We tried a few other cocktails on the menu, and everyone liked what they ordered.
- Good appetizers. Spinach artichoke dip was good, as were the chicken wings and fried tomatoes.
- People at our table ordered and liked shrimp & grits and crawfish 1/2 and 1/2.
The bad: 
- Service was insanely slow. It took 15 minutes for our drinks to arrive, another half an hour for our appetizers, and another half an hour for our entrees to arrive. I like a relaxed dining experience but I wanted to spend my day seeing things other than the inside of that restaurant.
- Pulled pork sandwich was awful. Bread was dry, hardly any pork. Do not recommend at all.Music is great, but it's really hard to hear anyone at the dinner table. I would highly suggest just going there to hear the music and drink, especially since the food is pretty bad. Nothing we ordered was good. The fries tasted like something you'd get at the fair or your high school football game. The shrimp and grits was dry and pretty tasteless. The basil lemonade is so sweet that it's difficult to drink. 
But the area is amazing. Frenchmen Street is seriously the best area in New Orleans. At every bar, you will see and hear some of the best jazz, blues, and brass bands. It's a funky, artistic street with tons of music, but not much in the food department....had the Sazerac. Super strong. Not the usual nuances I associate with this cocktail.  Fries.  Sorta cold ...not many.**FOOD POISONING**
**RUDE MANAGMENT**
First, one friend received warm oysters that nearly made her vomit. The waiter took them away while she rejected anything more. Another friend ordered a shrimp etouffee. Before we even left the restaurant he was vomiting and having vile bowl movements as his face turned completely red with hives. The young man claiming to be management refused to apologize, take any credit for poisoning my friends, or reduce anything more than a marginal amount of 7 dollars off a 60+ dollar bill. Out of frustration I did not leave a tip. To my delight I found out a week later that my debit card had been charged a 50% tip anyway. 
Please never go here. There is no reason to support such a lousy establishment.We had a great time here for dinner. The boudin ball appetizers were delicious, and the red fish platter was on point too. Service was great!Great food, great music, great drinks. Chef came out to check in and make sure we liked the food - was happy we did. Nice place to start your evening or stay the whole night.Walked in on a Monday evening looking for some live music. Bartender Abby was the best!!! Have a Southern Bella or Mojito, you won't be disappointed. Jon Roniger and the Good for Nothing Band was awesome! Great place!We were very happy here! Fried green tomatoes were excellent. Drinks - great! My husband had the pork belly and it was fantastic - great flavor. I had the steak frites and it was the best I have had in NOLA. Will be sure to visit again!Best is their happy hours till 7:30 pm house Vodka is Svedka.... Conversation with neighborhood folk makes it comfortable.
had a local fish, daily special, for lunch on a separate day --a tad salty, noticeably over done. one thing going for them, they have been around a long time.  i first went back in 2005.We were on Frenchmen and we were hungry. Our usual haunts were packed. Marigny Brasserie was right on the corner and we decided to check it out. One band was leaving the stage by the bar while another band began to setup shop. The hostess was sweet and said the wait was 45 minutes but considering the waits were longer everywhere else, we decided to stick it out.
Finally a table opened up by the bar. We grabbed it and waited 10 minutes until a waiter finally noticed us but whatever, it was fine. I went with the red beans and rice, even though it wasn't a Monday and I wasn't doing laundry (if you know the history of this dish, you'll understand why I brought this up in my review). My boyfriend went with the roast beef po'boy. My dish was delicious with meat that literally melted in your mouth from sitting in the beans all day cooking. My boyfriend loved his po'boy and now we understand why their fries are so well-known.
Prices were fair and neither of us could finish our dishes so you do get a lot of food. Live music isn't bad. In-between bands they had a solid mix of 90s alt. rock playing which I was singing along to (no shame).I thoroughly enjoyed my dining experience. The atmosphere was Bohemian. It reminded me a bit of San Fran actually. 
Try the Key Lime Martini!Had a big group of friends in town the week before Mardi Gras.  They wanted a late lunch and we were walking around looking for some place to eat.  I ate here years ago when I think it had another name.
Anyway, I did not eat but the other 7 people in my group did.  They had appetizers, entrees and desserts.  Everyone hated it.  
Unfortunately, I picked the place so I had to hear about it the rest of their trip.  Worst meal of their entire trip (this includes Clover Cafe at 5 am...).The drinks are good here, but the staff is not. Went here recently in the afternoon and it took forever to get a glass of water then forever again to get the actual drink order. The restaurant was not busy, the bar was not busy, but the bartender said she was "slammed". If 5 customers means they are slammed I would really hate to be there when it's actually busy because I would probably never get my drink!  I've tried this place more than once and been disappointed each time. There are way too many good restaurants and bars in this city to waste time on ones you know are poor, and that's really too bad because the drinks we got were good. Because of the poor service I would recommend skip this one and go anywhere else on Frenchmen st!What a great place! The waiters are super friendly and the customer service is really great. My steak was too fat and they instantly replaced it. Quality of the food is excellent, live music and not expensive at all:)I was pretty excited about returning here, since I've dined here a few times and was very pleased. That being said, that was a couple years ago when Miles Prescott was the executive chef. Since then, they've had several major menu changes.
Atmosphere
My date and I sat in the bar area at one of the tables with comfy chairs. Very comfy, but the big screen TV was kind of distracting. Ruthie's bar seems really great for a drink and a couple of dishes before heading outside to Frenchmen street to explore the jazz scene. It was busy, so it was pretty noisy, but not irritating. 
Service: 
Our waitress was very friendly with a great personality - spunky and fun. I had trouble deciding what I wanted, but she was patient and checked back frequently. Water was never empty :)
Food:
This is the disappointing part. I was sad they no longer offered the jalapeno cornbread. Really? That was awesome. Please bring it back! We started with the Louisiana Crawfish cakes, which were decent and yummy. 2 decently-sized cakes with remoulade on top served with cafeteria-style chopped lettuce and tomato? Ok...
I had the Veal Fettuccini Alfredo and asked for it with penne instead of fettucini, because it's a date... I need easy-to-eat food! The substitution didn't happen, and the veal was fried and greasy with a typical alfredo sauce.
My date ordered the Garlic Shrimp and Crawfish Penne - and they weren't lying with garlic! The party a table or two over could probably smell it, but the flavor wasn't overwhelming. Now that I think about it, it was a little fishy.
We didn't try the house specials. It looked pretty typical, and we were really craving Italian pastas. 
Drinks:
We love our reds! They have recognizable "safe" wines here; I recognized a lot of the brand-names like Kendall Jackson and such. We thought about ordering a Ruffino Chianti ($23), but chose the Tempernillo ($19) instead, and it was decently priced and delicious. I ordered a Coco Chanel (like a coconut-vodka martini), and that was very sweet and very coconut forward, which is exactly what my preference was that night. Looking over the cocktail menu I saw some classics and classics with twists - definitely thought out and looked delicious. 
All-in-all, this might as well be an Olive Garden with local seafood. Not stellar, not terrible, but I'll go somewhere else next date night, especially since it was pretty pricey and we didn't even get coffee or dessert. 
Fantastic staff!
Diversified cocktail menu
Acceptable wine list
Chain-quality food at 4-5-star prices
You can get a meal twice this quality somewhere else. 
Also, why would you keep the picture of the crawfish ravioli on your website if you no longer serve it? Broke my heart. This place needs an update. I am anxious to try the breakfast, though. Maybe that will be a different experience.Walking from Bourbon Street towards Frenchmen St corridor, this was the first bar we ran into. Decided to check it out real quick, end up just chilling outside talking and drinking some beer. 
Beer prices are your average New Orleans prices. Not too expensive. 
It wasn't too packed inside on a Saturday night, but it didn't matter anyway since we hung out outside people watching. 
No live music when I was there, but you could still hear some jazz playing over the loudspeakers. The waitress was okay. Didn't give us any attention more than she had to. 
Meh. I don't mind coming back, especially since there's actually no cover charge to get in.love the jazzie music! our waiter was so professional and knew his stuff!  (sorry think his name was Lawrence or Charles??) in any event he suggested mamas moonshine..yum! the po-boy had fried green tomatoes..fabulous!Friendly staff, decent selection of draft beers, TVs for college football while a little smooth jazz plays in the background.Truthfully I thought the food was ok. We had the fritters, gumbo, and fried pickles.
The fritters themselves were good, but the sauce was so heavy and overpowering. The gumbo was honestly me just not loving gumbo. The fried pickles were my husband's thing, he loves them lol.
The staff was the winner. They were so super friendly. Abby and I believe it was the owner were so nice and took great care of us.UM. $3 bloody marys and mimosas? Where have you been my entire life?
Big Red was our server and we LOVED her! She was so friendly and definitely did not hesitate to ask if we wanted a drink to go after our brunch!
For food, we ordered the fried green tomatoes, crawfish omelette with cheese grits and a side of sweet potato mash. The fried green tomatoes were good but fell short of my expectations. The crust of the tomatoes fell off as we were trying to cut it so it was almost like eating tomatoes and fried skin. I also saw some red tomatoes!! Blasphemy. It was drenched with a mustard/horseradish sauce that was a little too much for me.
The omelette was kinda watery on the inside and did not have that many pieces of crawfish. The cheese grits were good but too heavy and creamy for me. So different from the grits we had the prior day from Cafe Amelie.
The sweet potato mash was heavily flavored with cinnamon, would have been much better if they went with a bit less cinnamon.
Overall I didn't think the food was awful, just wasn't as good as everything else we had in New Orleans. The redeeming factors are their cheap/good drinks, the great wait staff, and a good view for people watching.Based on a recommendation for the live music here, we stopped in to also grab a bite and a drink.  And all were good.  Although we were seated where we couldn't see the musicians, we could hear them well and enjoyed their work.
The brasserie is a spacious, modern space with tables, booths, and bar seats.  Our server was friendly and helpful.  Service was a little slow at times, presumably because the place was pretty packed.
They have a nice selection of beers, as well as a full bar for all the cocktail and liquor fans out there.
The food menu is fairly extensive and provided a lot of appealing options.  Prices are reasonable.  Both the fried oyster tacos and the blackened fish that we tried were fresh and tasty.My family came to visit me in NOLA and this was our favorite dining experience of the 6-day eating tour. We loved the unique flavors, and our server was incredibly friendly and added to the experience. He told us that within the past 3 months there has been a complete re-haul of the restaurant's menu.  I can't speak for what it was like before, but I will be going back now!I came to New Orleans with my girlfriend and our good friend during our Spring Break in 2016. We stopped at this place since they had a happy hour and the place seemed empty. We sat at the bar and ordered different drinks - The Sazerac, Mama's Moonshine and Cucumber Cosmo. All of the drinks were really delicious and got me my evening buzz. We ordered another couple  round and really enjoying chatting with the bar tender. She was very friendly, and gave us good suggestions for places to eat and drink later in the night. I am usually not very talkative, but she made us all welcomed and comfortable. It is hard to come by places like these, but they are old school here. There was also two old guys playing music live. We also had a chance to talk and exchange some stories. It was a very unique experience getting to talk to locals and here about the city from their points of view. This was an awesome place and one should stop by if you ever want to hang out and talk to new people. The delicious drinks will always help.We stopped in here to get a glass of wine one night while walking around the Frenchman area. It was quiet and there were open tables so we went in.
Wine was fine, price average, the service just a tad slow but nothing to complain about. We went in late so the kitchen was closed and we did not get to try the food though I would go back to try that in the future.We had dinner at the brasserie and there was a really good band playing called ( Vegas Cola band ) the music really gave the place life energizing the crowd .
A few things to try from the menu the strawberry walnut salad , fried pickles and crawfish fritters
We will definitely be back .UPDATE:
I gave sitting outside at the front another go today and I should have stuck to my advice in my initial review, because it wasn't good. The waitress wasn't familiar with the menu and inevitably their were some minor mix ups because of it. 
 Worse yet were the pekid, wilted sprouts and the rotten avocados on my sandwich and the unmelted cheese on the grilled cheese that we ordered (they took one of the sandwiches of the bill). 
It used to be that regardless of the service, you could count on the food to be decent, but with my most recent experiences, I've got to remove this from my lists of recommended places.We went there twice! 
The food was fantastic. Gumbo and oyster poboy on BLT with Blackberry Mojito. Good music and wonderful staff. When I recall what wad best about New Orleans, it is at the top of my list. 
The area around it is also much less glitzy and fast. Good music and 'real' art, close to the Mississippi and the streetcar.Appetizers:

My coworkers and I decided to try out a new restaurant that none of us had ever been too. It was the best idea EVER!! I've passed up this place on the way to Snug Harbor all the time. I've noticed it but the front just looks like a small bar/cafe .. who knew there was a whole seated restaurant once you get passed all that. The food was incredible, the waitress was amazing, and the atmosphere was great!!!So here it is 3+ years later.  Party of 4 stopped in on a whim for lunch on Mardi Gras weekend.  
The dining room still presents itself well.  
Service was friendly but stretched.  The wait staff seemed to be hustling, but just too much ground to cover.  It was slow getting anyone's attention and slow getting drinks - hardly the recipe for success anytime. Given that maybe 1/4 of the seats were occupied during Mardi Gras, it's hard to understand.    
Not impressed with the crossed out drink section in the menu.  Maybe this was a last minute bar crisis, but it looked like it had been that way for a while.  
Food was a disappointment.  We were informed after ordering that the kitchen was out of pork.  Out of the main ingredient that shows up in 20% of the menu offerings at noon?  How does that happen?  The other entrees were no more than average.  Way too much mayo on the Turkey/Ham Marigny #1, the vegetarian hamburger had little taste and what taste there was would not compare favorably with a freezer burned bean burrito.  The Marigny burger was ok, nothing special, overcooked.  The sides were good - Mac and Cheese, Sweet Potato and hand cut fries.  
There was a billing error that the staff did handle in a professional manner.
Great location, good dining environment but until they get the service and kitchen back on track, there are too many other good choices to bother eating here.  Time for a restaurant rescue?Awful. I took my husband because it was very good several years ago. The menu was lacking, food was terrible.  The only positives, server was good and nice and the atmosphere is not bad. Waste of money in a town with so much good food. Will not go back!Great vegan burritos and awesome service. Will come back. Decent prices.Came here for dinner.  We had the BBQ shrimp for appetizer, pork special & seafood platter as entrees, & crème brulee for dessert.
Food - 5 stars out of 5.  Awesome! Yummy!  Perfect!
Service - 10 stars out of 5.  Our waitress, Roseanne, anticipated our every need before we even realized it.  She came back to our table 3 times at the proper moments to see if we were ok and if we needed anything else. BEST SERVICE EVER of all the restaurants we tried in NOLA. 
Cleanliness - 5 stars out of 5. 
Ambiance - a little noisy due to the acoustics of the building but what the heck...it's NOLA!  Have fun!  
Summary:
Unpretentious, fun, place w/ great service & good food!  Highly recommended!This was an amazing find to stumble into. Service was great and friendly and the food was amazing! The BBQ shrimp and rosemary grits were phenomenal! Highly recommend.Lunch-2 people-split blue cheese iceberg wedge salad.nice salad withonions,bacon bits and a light vinaigrette.Main course was friedf chicken-3 pcs very crispy-with red beans and rice and collard greens.will order again.Split dessert-mixed fruit cobbler-forgettable. Excellent  service-Will go back againWe dined there multiple times.  Every dish was excellent, very high-quality food and drink at reasonable prices.  Looking forward to going back again.  Exceptional.I had my birthday dinner here last week. We started out with the fried green tomatoes, crawfish fritters and the brown butter cauliflower soup. We enjoyed all of them especially the soup. Lick the bowl delicious! Most of my table ordered the fried chicken. I have to say it was the best fried chicken I've eaten. It wasn't greasy or over cooked. The meat was moist and full of flavor. I will definitely order it when I go back. I had the special, soft shell crab poboy. The crab was huge and fresh. Very tasty! It paired with my rose` perfectly. I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a taste of local flavor and away from tourist traps.Fantastic Cajun fare! Loved the fried green tomatoes & boudin balls. The lavender lace cocktail was delish! Amazing BBQ shrimp & grits. Enjoyed the atmosphere & live music. I highly recommend this place.As always my wife and I like to break out of the tourist trap areas to find more eclectic and authentic foods. We chose this place specifically because we were craving shrimp and grits and the ambiance was extremely inviting. We quickly knew it was the right choice after meeting Carl who was our waiter/server. Carl's approach could not be any better.  My wife just said "I like Carl." He has a kind smile and relaxed demeanor. He makes you feel like you've known him for years. He totally made the entire experience. The BBQ Shrimp and Grits were to die for, they seasoned perfectly and the fresh rosemary took the meal over the top! Did I forget to rave about the Cucumber and Basil lemonade mixed drink?!?! Because that drink cooled us off on a hot summer day. Can't wait to come back to this place next time we are in town!My friend and I went this past Saturday while visiting the Frenchmen art market and i must say that out of all the places I ate at, this was my favorite. I ordered the po'boy sandwich and rosemary grits. The grits were AWESOME. The rosemary added a new twist to the grits that I will definitely try to duplicate at home. They had live music which was what I really wanted to experience in my first visit to the city. I would have given it 5 stars but the Mama's Moonshine cocktail tasted bland, didn't taste the liquor in it at all and it had too much mint in it for my taste. Also the waitress was nice but really didn't show her face as often as I expected. Don't get my wrong, I wouldn't have liked her coming every minute, but I had to keep asking her for things that should have given to us from the moment we sat down or at least when the dishes were served. The place wasn't that busy for her not be more attentive. After we left, we saw her having a smoking break, and now I know why she wasn't as alert as I had hoped.We came in here to use the bathroom on Halloween when we were out on Frenchmen and we decided to come back the next day for lunch. I am glad we did because it was damn good and you can't beat the location. We had the tacos (one was fried fish, the other was black bean with goat cheese) and salad and they were all really good. The place was empty in the late afternoon but we did not mind at all. Pretty decent and friendly bar service, we would come back!Truly one of New Orleans' best kept not-so-secrets. A gem.I'm not sure why this place only has 3 stars. My lunch, was one of the best lunches I may have ever had. I got the bbq shrimp and grits, and I moaned so much my wife got jealous. Everyone at our table was thrilled. We were all a little drunk (we were on vacation so don't judge) but I would have been in love sober. Like that girl in college who wore those tight...never mind.Marigny Brasserie a major "Step Up" Corner Bar with great food. Truffle Fries to Tempura Onion Rings line the Small Plates but the Crawfish Fritters are well just freakin soawesome, yes it's a word for these fritters for sure. On to the Pork Belly Tacos "Silence" follows your first bite then sounds meant for your bedroom. Need I say more.Convinced to come in by the server, who was getting some fresh air as my friend was passing by, this quaint establishment is adorned with original paintings by local artists. With a warm, comfortable atmosphere and fully stocked bar, it is a hip place to go at the northern part of Frenchmen Street away from all the "energy" of the street. 
The food is freshly made daily with fresh ingredients and it is obvious from the taste. I ordered the gumbo with crawfish fritter and catfish. The server informed us that the gumbo was slow-cooked all day. It was delightful, full of flavor, its broth taking on the seafood flavors that were blended in it. Although the catfish came with fries and jalapeño slaw, I opted to forgo the fries for red beans and rice. The helpings were more than one person should eat in one sitting. However, I did my best to put a dent into it! The catfish was breaded and I'm not really a fan. I don't like the texture of the meat, as moisture is trapped and I find the catfish to be too soggy. Such was the case. It still had good flavor and was what I would expect. Hit with a little hot sauce and it's all good. The jalapeño slaw, on the other hand, was delightful. With just enough heat contrasted with the cool from the leafy greens, it was a pleasure to eat. The red beans and rice, also, did not disappoint.
Our server was on point, not writing a thing down but getting the order right even with the changes that I made. He was courteous and engaging, making sure that our needs were met.
It is a great place with great ambiance. Located walking distance from where I was staying, it is a great establishment and I'd go back for the food.Wandered in here on a whim, very hungry and exhausted after a day of walking. The atmosphere was so quiet and relaxing which was a relief after having spent the majority of the evening in the quarter. The server was so friendly and attentive. The music was beautiful, light, and jazzy. I had the crawfish Marigny, a Cajun Alfredo over linguine with crawfish. It was one of the best dishes I've ever had! Like not just saying that, it was so incredibly satisfying. I also got a side of red beans and rice which was equally amazing. 
Over all with the food, the great service, and serene atmosphere this place is officially going on my "will return to" list for when ever I'm in visiting.
