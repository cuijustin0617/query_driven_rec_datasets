I was not impressed. The bread was delicious, but that was about it.
The Seafood Paella was alright, small shrimp and only two mussels in the medium size. And the mussels were overcooked.
The grilled calamari tasted like rubber. I was really not expecting what came out. I have never seen calamari that looked like a big round cut up pancake. I was expecting small tendrils. I am not a calamari expert though. 
The last thing we had was the lamb stew, which I have heard is really good. It tasted good, if not a little too salty. But it was not a stew, but more of a bowl full of chunks of slow cooked lamb with a carrot here and there. 
I have been looking forward to trying this place for a while, but it was a disappointment. I will not be going back. It did have a great atmosphere though. Quite loud, but cozy.I came here with a very enthusiastic friend and I was pleased with how good the experience was.  The appetizer was the calamari and I am not sure we will get that again, bc I was thinking it was the one that doesn't come in a patty. Yet when I looked at the menu, that is what it said it would come like. My take home lesson was to read the description of an item prior to ordering. 
We had the veggie paella and it was awesome. So flavorful! The rice was perfect and the veggies were just right.Great little neighborhood restaurant. My wife and I have been a couple times since we moved into the neighborhood. Both times we have brought bottles of wine and beer for ourselves, as their corkage fee for both is very reasonable. The first time we had the charcuterie plate and ceviche, which were both very good, then finished with paella, which is ok. Second time around we split caprese salad, ceviche, squid and chorizo, and a few other tapas. Great stuff! The bread with the garlic aioli is addicting. 
Tip: This place is very popular with larger groups, but has more seating for two tops. If it is just two of you, the wait generally isn't very long.Two things: 3 dollar sangria and Seafood Paella!!! You gotta try both
My first visit and I loved the place. The interior is set up very cozy and homey with the decorations, people laughing and talking, and the open kitchen. It's like your dining with family.  
The food is excellent and made to order. Totally worth the wait and you can tide yourself over with some sangria in the meantime.  
I will definitely be returning.Friendly neighborhood restaurant! Great ceviche. Pleasant change from traditional New Orleans fare. I eat here 2-3 times a month and haven't had a bad dish yet. Best flan in town.***QUALITY***FOOD***FOR***LOW***PRICES***
The food was delicious, we ordered: appetizers: the mushrooms, ceviche and crabmeat for the main: two salmon dishes which was great quality and one shrimp pasta very yummy indeed. For desert the flan - to share - it was so good we ordered a second one :-), for drinks we shared two bottles of Pinot Noir. For 3 people the check came to $162 (before tip) great value!!
We went on a Tuesday evening 8pm and had to wait 20 min to be seated. The restaurant is very small, bright and not too pleasant to sit in. I wouldn't go here for a romantic dinner or special occasion. It's too crammed and noisy. The service was a little slow and messy, because it was busy, our waiter tried his best.
For a casual dinner I would go back here and recommend it to everyone else.Went here on a date night with my boyfriend and at first we were a little skeptical. It seemed like the entrees really just weren't all that special. I like to always try to order food that I just can't make at home or normally wouldn't and nothing for the entrees seemed to peak our interests besides maybe the lamb. 
So we decided tapas it was! And wow! Great choice. We got the crab tropical....AMAZING! Easily both of our favorite dish. Got the ceviche....THE BEST ceviche I've had in New Orleans so far....easily! And the Antipasto....the blue cheese is super strong and everything else was delicious but also very standard. 
The crab tropical is what made it for us! And I was so happy to find good ceviche. The plates sizes are HUGE for tapas also so it's perfect for sharing but we were definitely stuffed. The house made sangria was tasty also.
The manager, Courtney, was the one who was serving us that night and she was super nice and enthusiastic. Overall it was a really goo experience. The place definitely filled up after we got there just a little after they opened at 5:30 so maybe get there before the crowd does. Will definitely be going back.This is my first Yelp. I don't Yelp. I feel Yelpers are bored people that have nothing better to do than carelessly nitpick and then feel good about how cool words look in formation after they put them there. 
I have worked in bars and restaurants for YEARS. 
We walked into Lola's 30 minutes before the kitchen closes on a Friday night.  Perfectly acceptable in my mind in the realm of customer ettiquette, I thought. 
This place is "adorable" and "lively" and I assume this place gets by on looks and charm, because the food and service were lame. The seafood paella was overcooked fried rice with fishy gumballs. Nothing bright or light about it- which is the point, right. This is your signature dish.   Our manager/server was condescending when she removed the plate.  "Have you ever eaten here? That's just how it is." (I paraphrase) It's heavy and flavorless. The seafood was overcooked.  It wasn't crunchy at all.
That's how it is. 
The replacement trout dish was ok and at least had flavor.  The biggest problem with the dish was how it was delivered "I hope you like this...this is how we make it here". That's the spirit, asshole. 
I don't relish sending food back to a kitchen. It's a drag to hear you didn't do something right in any aspect of the foodservice realm. It's also embarrassing to embarrass the person/people you are dining with by sending back an item.  I drove 10 hours to New Orleans to eat and drink. Empty water glasses half the night and no eye contact from anyone else in the staff (even at the end of a service on Friday night) is not good.  Follow up within a few bites. Check on your tables. Manager/server-you are incredibly insincere and really need to work on your tableside manner.  
I tipped.  I said thank you.  
You get an extra star because you didn't spill anything on me and because the host caught me dropping my knife and replaced that shit immediately. Johnny on the spot.  Good eye. 
Take a break from the service industry and maybe you will realize how shitty the rest of the work place really is.  I need to do it every once in a while. 
My name is Doug Niemczura...and I am a Yelper.The seafood paella and caesar salad are my favorites. The bread and aioli at the beginning of the meal are lovely as well. The restaurant is VERY small and I do not think they do reservations. Unless you want to wait a while, groups of four or fewer are best and going earlier in the evening is better.AMAZING. My date and I ordered 2 tapas and a small paella and we couldn't finish our meal for 1. Great service, lots of garlic, good wine list and nice atmosphere.Friendly, efficient, neighborly service. And serving delicious, delicious food. My whole table was impressed- and happy. Their sangria=dee-licious! I'll be going back.This place is good if you are looking for mediocre, bland food in a kitsch & very loud setting. We found all of the dishes to be aching for some salt, and not very fresh. The art is tacky & you can barely hear one another over the dinn of people all around you. They were out of many of the things we really wanted, and put us at a table where waitresses were constantly clanging silverware against glass behind our ears. Oh, and the bread is $0.30 per piece!A coworker and I had the paella tonight and per usual it was fantastic. You cannot replicate there paella, its the only and the best in New Orleans. Jambalaya is great but this is so much better. I love Lola's Sangria which goes well with your meal and the price is amazing for the quantity and quality. Who needs chain restaurants when you have places like this.this is a cute little place with great homemade sangria, good food, and plenty of veg/vegan options.I loved the neighborhood atmosphere of Lola's and the food and sangria were delicious! Can't wait to bring family from out of town here. Will definitely be back soon!Great paella. Red sangria is very very yummy. Service is good. Love the fresh bread n garlic butter they serve also. 
Its small, intimate, good for a date :PLola's was recommended by our Airbnb host as their favorite restaurant in New Orleans. Food was amazing, but you better love garlic. We had the ceviche, grilled calamari, garlic shrimp and the shrimp pasta. All were delicious. We finished up with the decadent flourless chocolate cake for an exceptional ending to a wonderful day.Dinner is always so relaxed and enjoyable here. The paella is certainly worth the wait.  My only recommendation - Breath mints with the check.  The garlic butter with the rolls is killer!Always on the Money with product,  service and atmosphere.  We even dined here for New Years Eve and my comments held more than true.  the shrimp pasta is my fav with the crabmeat tropicale salad.  Always so fresh.  You just can't go wrongI had been wanting to try Lola's for a while now and I finally took the opportunity to the other night.  I read lots of reviews, most of them raving about how great Lola's is. I have to say I wasn't blown away like I thought I would be. Maybe I was expecting too much because of the reviews or maybe I just didn't get the right things,  but I've had Spanish food before at other places and I liked them much better.  We started with Sangria which was great and the antipasto, which I was very pleased with, I mean if anyone knows me, they know I am always satisfied with a plate of cheese with other fixins, and Cabrales cheese is one of my favorites. Then we shared the tomato basil salad, which I was also very happy to eat. We got the bread with the famous garlic "butter", and I just don't know what all the hype is about. I am a big garlic lover so I thought this would be my favorite part of the meal, but I was kind of disappointed when I tasted the garlicky spread. First of all it tasted a little bit rancid, like the olive oil that it is made of was not fresh. Then I had a few pieces of hard garlic that I had to take out of my mouth which made me wonder if they actually used some granulated garlic with the fresh garlic. I mean it had that spicy bite that fresh raw garlic has, but those hard pieces just threw it all off for me. Then I ordered the veggie paella. I just wasn't in the mood for a whole lot of meat, and I had a feeling that if I got the seafood paella it would have the iodine flavor I can't stand that seafood has sometimes, especially in shrimp that are on the larger size which are in the seafood paella. My dining companion got the seafood variety.  So I got my paella and it was so pretty, all the colors of the vegetables and the yellow rice. I was very happy with it's visual qualities. I took my first bite thinking it was going to be as amazing as it looked, I mean I love all the veggies that were in it, but I was, to my surprise let down quite a bit. It was kind of bland, honestly, except for the overpowering garlic that was in it.  My mouth was already inundated with garlic from the bread spread, so the garlic in the paella was just too much. It didn't really have enough other seasoning besides the saffron spice and it just didn't do anything for me. I had a bite of my BF's seafood paella, and I was really glad I didn't get that one because sure enough the overpowering iodine was all over that dish. I really wanted to like Lola's and maybe I need to give it another try with some of the other dishes, but as for this review and at this point, I am not impressed.  It was better than Barcelona Tapas, but I think I will stick to Cafe Granada for now when I want Spanish food.Incredible Old World Charm, With Authentic Spanish Eats!
My best friends surprised me with a birthday dinner here.  Atmosphere is intimate and fun, great for family dinners or dates!  
Food was absolutely delicious.  We ordered the ceviche, 3 different types of paella, and of course a little sangria on the side.  I would recommend it :DThis is by far my favorite Spanish place in New Orleans, I usually stick to the paella cause it's really hard not to order it, but last time I was there we ventured a little more and tried the duck, which was awesome, and some stuffed peppers which were definitely something else.
I always recommend this place, be warned though, their sangria goes down way to smoothly. You may loose track of how many bottles you already had!... :PThis was my second experience at Lola's. My first time was wonderful. I arrived at about 8 pm today with my parents for my birthday dinner. The place was pretty busy but there were two empty tables for two people. We asked the Coordinator, Courtney, if we could be seated at one of the empty tables by either joining the two or by pulling up a chair. She informed us that they don't have a policy that allows that because of concerns about space and that we would have to wait for a bigger table. After sitting outside for about 15 minutes, we were seated inside. About 45 minutes into our meal, as we are about to receive our entree dishes, we see a crowd of six white women come into the restaurant. They were not asked to wait; in fact, two two-people tables were put together and two chairs from other tables pulled to accommodate all members of their party, despite the previous claim by Courtney that they had no such policy. As we were sitting next to this table, we were appalled by the blatant discrimination. We asked to speak to the manager, which was Courtney, and she denied that she had said that it was against their policy. In fact, she was quite hostile and did not offer any apology. Needless to say, I will never eat here again after experiencing such obvious racism, which is quite disappointing because the food here is delicious, and I will be filing a formal complaint.Vegetarian paella in the United States that tastes that good?! If I could go to Lola's more I absolutely would. 
Every time I have been everyone at the table - vegetarian or not - has been happy with their food choices. And who doesn't love a night involving sangria?
Also, SO glad they are no longer cash only. That was always a major deterrent for me as I never have cash on hand.Quaint hole in the wall restaurant with a fun and vibrant atmosphere.  Street parking.  Food is mouth wateringly delicious.  I don't know what they put in the butterly garlic concoction that they serve with the bread but its just down right delicious.   We ordered the grilled calamari and the garlic shrimp.  Both were amazing to say the least.  The calamri was tender and seasoned to perfection.  The sauce that the shrimp is served in is a delciosuily garlic concoction.  Its great for dipped bread in also.  
The seafood paella was nice but not my most favorite part of the meal.  If you love garlic, then you'll LOVE Lola's.This is my favorite restaurant in the entire city. Food never disappoints. Garlic shrimp and sangria is a must.Lola's Spanish cuisine is as good as it gets when in search for authentic Latin food!
The seafood Paella is a MUST! Garlic shrimp for an app and red or white sangria please!!!
That is correct, you heard me right. Both are AMAZING!
It's very rare these days to find a restaurant that offers both great food along with excellent customer service, but Lola's has managaged to make that happen! arrive early, order anything ,sit and enjoy!Order the ceviche, the cabrata (lamb stew) and the bread with the olive oil garlic butter. Very honey delicious flavors in this little neighborhood gen.The place is cozy and the service is very kind to you, the meal is delicious and you can enjoy with friend and family the tasty red sangria.Had a delicious vegetarian plate and sangria. Definitely recommend for a nice night out.We have been to Lola's 5 or 6 times and I swear it gets better every time.  It is a very small restaurant so there is often a line to get in.  I try different things every time I go and they food is always fantastic.We walked in and the aroma of the food just captures you right away. I live how tiny this place is. I felt like I was eating at a friends home. The hostess and waitress were so sweet. The grilled calamari and garlic mushrooms are to die for. The paella's is out of this world prolly one of the best Ive had coming from living in Miami for years.I dont even know how to start describing their mushroom appetizer, besides YUM. Ok, so you will need to brush your teeth/gum/mouthwash, something to clean your mouth after you eat it because its super garlicky (not as much as their aoili that they serve with the bread- its a true mashed garlic aoili, not mayo) , but the mushrooms are delicious. Ive been here several times and I havent brought myself to try any other appetizers because they are so good. I always split the seafood paella here & love it. Very flavorful, very fresh. They also have affordable wine bottles, and I *think* a corking fee of like $5 bucks. I havent tried the sangria because Im not really into sweet alcoholic drinks, but Ive heard its good. Lola's has become my fiancee and I's go-to date night place.PAELLA! (Should I just leave my review as that?!)
I LOVE Lola's! It's definitely a NOLA little local restaurant! You probably won't see more than a table of tourists there (Granted we were tourists!)
We walked in the restaurants and its decoration is rusty, very European country, your grandma's kitchen style!
We ordered the homemade red wine sangria and it was delicious.
The bread was fresh and the garlic butter was delicious! The friendly server told us it's not butter but a special vegetable oil! Yum and good for my cholesterol level!
For appetizer I ordered a mussel dish served with a warm sauce over it. I have never had mussels that good. The sauce provided the mussel just enough acidity to bring out the seafood flavor! I would go back to NOLA just for that!
We ordered a small meat and a small seafood paella, both of them were very good and with different flavors. The meat one had a very nice savory taste to it; while the seafood one is more simple. They probably want to highlight the fresh mussel, fish, squid and shrimp they put in the rice!
Yes, it's not cajun, but Lola's a must for foodie in NOLA!Everything tasted great.
From the whipped olive oil and garlic to the paellas, everything was a wonderful experience.  Great location.  The open kitchen is really cool.  You can see them making the food right in front of you, and all of the waitstaff seems really sweet.  We also had a garlic soup, a caprese salad, and some kind of vegetable plate.  
This is a great place to bring a family member from out of town, or that special someone when you want to pop the question ;-)I love this restaurant. It is a wonderful taste of Spain in Nola. The paellas are excellent. I normally order three paellas; one meat, one seafood, and one vegetarian; for our group, and pitchers of sangria. It is a blast. The atmosphere is causal, friendly, and relaxing. The kitchen is open if you enjoy watching people cook, and the walls are covered in local art. The paellas are excellent. The meat paella is a combination of chicken and chorizo, whereas the seafood one has fish, octopus, and mussels. My vegan friend loved the vegetarian paella and now considers Lola's her favorite restaurant. It is a wonderful place that I always visit when in Nola.The best little restaurant in mid-city! Friendly staff, cute and cozy atmosphere, delicious food!! The paella was incredible and the garlic chicken gets a five out of five! The butter was VERY garlicky - so be prepared to stink. Totally worth it though!! Loved everything about this place.jambalaya has nothing on paella. the flavors are amazing. its like a carnival in for the taste buds. this place rocks, will go again and afordable too.This was quite the find. A Brussels sprouts appetizer that was so amazing and delicious. Very tasty but would not share the recipe bummer. The paella was so rich and tasty I had three helpings. Only 13 tables but small and intimate. One has to try this place.An oldie but a goodie it had been a minute since I had been to Lola's. I often contemplate coming to Lola's but because it's small, intimate, popular and doesn't take reservations I usually decide to go elsewhere that I know I won't have a long wait. But on this hot summer weekday evening I was long overdue a return to a restaurant I fell in love with years ago. My reunion was one like meeting up with an old friend that starts right back up where you left off. I lucked out it wasn't busy the evening I went and the paella was as good as I had remembered. I started out with a few good starters too the gazpacho and also the garlic artichoke special. Both flavorful and fresh. I appreciate all the vegetarian options they offer here. Good food, good service in a cute little local sort of hole in the wall location make this oldie but a goodie still as charming as it was the first time I tried it 15 years ago.Luckily, we narrowly beat the dinner rush- the somewhat small dining room was overflowing with guests as soon as we were seated. While we waited for a few small plates, we popped open our personal bottle of wine (BYOB and a $5.00 corking fee) and fended off our mounting hunger with the antipasto plate of cheeses, prosciutto, and chorizo.  Once we polished off the garlic shrimp and the avocado stuffed with crabmeat and a spicy aioli, we could barely muster a few bites of Lola's ridciulously good specialty- paella with sausage, chicken, shrimp, crab, squid, and octopus.Have always enjoyed Lola's but called in today 15 mins before stop seating to put in a take out order.  I was told that "They weren't taking out orders tonight."  I replied that I've ordered take out from Lola's before but was told "Oh, we normally do, we're just not tonight."
Perhaps they should update their website to reflect that do take out orders, selectively, on a case by case basis.  Too many restaurants in this town to do this - will choose to visit and recommend elsewhere from nowhere.  Pretty disappointing.After cooking paella, there is usually a layer of toasted rice at the bottom of the pan, called socarrat in Spain. This is considered a delicacy among Spaniards and is ESSENTIAL to a GOOD paella. The toasted rice develops on its own if the paella is cooked over a burner or open fire. If cooked in an oven, however, it will not. To correct this, place the paellera over a high flame while listening to the rice toast at the bottom of the pan. Once the aroma of toasted rice wafts upwards, remove it from the heat. The paella must then sit for about five minutes (most recipes recommend the paella be covered with a tea-towel at this point) to absorb the remaining broth.
What Lola's served me last night had absolutely no toasted rice at the bottom and was basically a decent tasting rice and seafood casserole. I wouldn't order it again for $28. Really cute place, lovely waitstaff in neon and spandex workout gear didn't exactly add to ambiance of establishment.Our meal at Lola's was (almost) perfect.  I started off with sangria on the patio, which was fine but nothing to write home about.  The garlic butter served with the pistolettes was soo yummy and had a serious garlicky bite.  I highly recommend the ajoblanco (cold almond soup served with grapes), which is an interesting and delicious departure from your typical American soup.  I ordered the pisto as the main course, which was perfectly seasoned and just the right portion size.  For dessert, we had the tres leches cake.  It was ok.  I've definitely had better tres leches at Mexican restaurants, and I found the chocolate drizzles on the cake to be unnecessary and distracting from the tres leches flavors.  I was a little disappointed at the end when the wait person asked us to leave after we paid our bill.  At least she was polite about it.  But honestly there were other tables that were already empty, and I certainly didn't see a huge line of people waiting to be seated...Overall impression:
Food was really good. Solid place. Very popular obviously. Not a must-go for me, but it was a nice experience.
Average price: $25-40/person
Positives:
-paella is good
-food is solid
-the bread is delicious and comes with garlic aioli
-service is fine
-ambience is fine
Negatives:
-only street parking
-it can get crowded and there is often a wait
Overall, this is a solid place. I would say they did everything pretty well (service, food, ambience, value). Has a fairly classy feel but you can drop in with casual clothes and not feel too out of place. The best thing about this place for me was the bread. Warm and fresh with delicious garlic aioli. Mm-mm. I heard that they charge for bread here ($0.50 each) but we didn't get charged (although we only ordered one). The paella was solid. The ceviche was a bit too citrus-Ey for our tastes but they sure gave a lot of it! We also had a lot of paella leftover. My one tip would be to be careful not to order too much, which can be easy to do.we were torn about patronizing Lola's, literally while sitting in front of it. We had read about it in Beth D'adonno's The Hunt, New Orleans. The paella, the apps, we wanted it all. But before I get into our crisis of conscience with Lola's, I have to say, the Seafood Paella was incredible, the ceviche, mushrooms and crab avocado salad were beyond.  really awesome, and the service was spot on...for a reason.
and here's where we were stopped in our tracks before we even got in the door....we arrive and are told they were just clearing a 4top and be just a few  minutes...about 3 mins into our wait a woman arrives with her guests. she has them wait at the curb while she marches in. soon after she is back out, with the hostess asking her what she would like to do. the woman points at the waiting list and marches off to the curb loudly commenting to her guests how she recently inherited LOLA'S, soon. after they all March past us to the 4top....I have Never seen a restaurantuer put themselves ahead of paying guests... and the disregard she showed for those serving her...She is No Restaurantuer.!
 the wait staff, and i assume her brother, clearly saw this, definitely stepping up or doing their regular great job, either way they made our experience enjoyable, and probably somewhat kindred. 
great food, great service, bad owner who has no appreciation for what it took to get that restaurant where it is.Perhaps my most visited restaurant of the last decade, this place is a favorite of locals, especially those who live in Mid-City. 
A great restaurant for a date or to enjoy with a small group of friends. They do not take reservations, so it's first come, first served. I like to get there around 7-7:30 before they get packed. You can bring your own wine (they do have a small wine list now that they've gotten their liquor license) and drink it while you wait outside at the provided table and chairs.
 It is a small Spanish restaurant (cash only) with unique artwork on the walls for sale. My personal favorites are the shrimp and garlic app, the paella, and the rack of lamb. I love grabbing a bottle or two of shiraz and/or petite sirah and heading over there for a delicious, cheap meal. A place where I always take my out of town friends to enjoy some local flavor.The meat paella is going to be added to one of my "best meals ever" list.  Worth the wait, the special salad was great too.  Party of 4- great evening.This is the restaurant I picked to celebrate my birthday. I was satisfied but I wasn't blown away by the food. The atmosphere and location is beautiful and intimate - perfect for dates and small parties. Their garlic bread, grilled calamari, duck, eggplant, and flan were delicious! We ordered a bottle of Sangria and it was probably one of the best Sangria I have ever had!!! Their gazpacho and ceviche were not my favorites (I've had better). And finally, I was very excited to try their paella since everyone and their mamas were raving about it. We ordered the combination Paella and it was extremely watery... such a disappointment. In summary, this place is lovely and the food is settles for average. Prices are decent. Service is wonderful. Street parking was hard to find. I might possibly come back to this place but not in the near future.I've been going to Lola's since I moved to N.O ten years ago and I love the food. I am spanish and I think the paella is not the same as 10 years ago but...still good. The only thing that bothers me about this place is the inconsistency and the SERVICE. It's sooooo bad. Servers don't care if your water is refilled, they always have an attitude. Me and friends went there last night and we had a very good time except for the service. TERRIBLE!. The owners should pay more attention to that.This is one of my favorite restaurants in the city! Their paella is TO DIE FOR! Sooooooo yummy! I love to bring friends and family there for a treat!If I were rating just the gazpacho they would get 5 stars hands down...unfortunately I'm not. After hearing everyone rave about this place for YEARS I had been dying to finally try it. Decided to go there for my birthday dinner with a small group of friends, and was left wishing I had chosen somewhere else. Maybe my expectations were too high but the paella (we split the veggie and the seafood) was not all it was cracked up to be. The veggie was however much better than the seafood which tasted very "fishy". The Sangria was just average. The mushrooms were fantastic as was the garlic spread for the bread. I would have been better off getting two cups of gazpacho and noshing on the mushrooms app instead of wasting all those carbs on flavorless rice. Have they gone drastically down hill or was everyone wrong? I may give them another shot but I definitely wont be re-visiting the paella situation. I still prefer my go-to Spanish tapas place, Cafe Granada any day!Great food and a nice ambiance. Loved living around the block from here because the smell of garlic was always pleasant t my nostrils. A pretty decent paella and always quality soups. Would recommend for a nice Wednesday evening dinner for 2.I'm always a little intimidated going to a new restaurant. I'm not sure I really noticed until visiting Lola's. It's right around the corner from my house and everybody says it's the best, but it took me a while to get there. Going with a group of four led to some of the trepidation. Will it be difficult to get a table for four since they don't take reservations? Should I try to go early to get our name in or something? Wait, the paella takes how long to prepare? Is that a long time, I don't actually know. BYOB is ok? Or no? Wait, what about attire? I think it's casual, but when I peeked in, I saw nice white table cloths. Damn, pay attention to what people were wearing! As usual, it turned out there was no real reason for fear. Lola's is a nice little place.
It is a little tight, maybe seating for about 30 people at around 10 tables. We were tucked into a corner near the kitchen - if the people at the table behind us wanted to get up, I think we all may have had to stand up (luckily they didn't get up). You can look right into the kitchen, which is always kind of neat (well, usually, assuming you don't see roaches and rats running around; and we didn't). They have a lot of art by Simon, which isn't bad. Despite being tight, it wasn't that noisy. I will say that it was a Monday night and the place was mostly full, so good chance of a long wait on a prime evening. Oh, by the way, attire is fully casual - a guy and a girl even came in straight from the beach (no beaches within an hour or so of New Orleans, but they did it, guy in trunks and t-shirt, girl in bikini with some cover-up thing). For atmosphere, I'll give it a 17 out of 30, nothing outstanding, nothing bad.
We found out the food is prepared using old traditional Spanish recipes. The original owner was from Spain and he used his mother's recipes. After he passed away, the kids took over, still using the same recipes. My understanding was that it has the best paella in town; I'm not sure if that's saying a lot because I have never seen paella anywhere else in town (of course, I haven't looked for it either). We went for three different kinds - meat, seafood and combination (keep in mind, it takes 30 minutes to prepare paella, I'm still not sure if that's a terribly long time to wait for dinner, seems like most good food at a legit restaurant would take close to that, but nice of them to warn you). Not knowing much about paella, I did read some of the Yelp reviews and some say there is supposed to be more of a crust of some sort on the bottom of the skillet, which supposedly tastes great. Reviewers commented that Lola's didn't have that and it's more of a casserole than paella. Being my first time eating it, I have no idea; it tasted pretty good, but I am not sure what was so special about it, it tasted like a rice casserole with some meat. Decent enough, but not something I'd write home about (unless this gets read by somebody at home, then I will have sort of written home about it). We also had the calamari appetizer, which was very interesting. It was not tentacles or anything like that. It was basically calamari steak (as they described), grilled. Served with a good spicy cocktail-type sauce. While it looked strange, it still had the rubbery squid taste. It was okay, but...well, I probably like friend calamari better (imagine that, me, liking fried better; weird). So as far as food, I'll give this a 30 out of 50.
The service was very good. I dropped in a little before six (there was one couple eating at the time) to see what they thought the wait might be (no idea) and if I could put my name in early (nope). So we went back at a little after 6:30 and there was only one table remaining for four. There was a six-top table in the window that would have been much better, but they wouldn't give it up, which makes sense, even though nobody ever came to take it. Our waitress was very good - they have wine, or you can bring your own for a reasonable $5 corkage fee. We did the corkage fee and also had sangria (very good!). Waitress was very attentive and friendly, maybe the best part of the visit. Service is a 17 out of 20.
Final score is 64 (I created a restaurant ranking system which includes a total of 100 points: 50 for food, 30 for atmosphere and 20 for service). I expected something a lot more based on how highly friends recommended it, but maybe paella isn't the ideal dish for me; I still think it's worth trying.This is an update on the service not the food. The last few times the waitstaff was just unfriendly and off putting.  I'm a really nice super smily person and I didn't get a grin the entire dinner.  Not bad service but something has changedI have loved Lola's for as long as I can remember. The garlic chicken is awesome!! Ceviche- awesome! Mussles-awesome! I love the fact that you can bring in your own wine. I have introduced many friends to this little place. I have never had a bad experience at Lola's. Expect a short wait (a little longer on weekends) but well worth it!Let me start with dessert because the almond nugget ice cream is so good.  I usually get it with either the flan and/or the no-flour chocolate cake along with a spoon for everyone and play dessert chess, your move!  
Garlic soup and garlic sautéed mushrooms are a must and I also enjoy the antipasto plate.  Salads are always fresh, again something to share and for the main dish the grilled fish, seared tuna w/ mojo sauce, or the pork tenderloin are all superb.
Of course for the big share there's the paella served up with seafood, meat, or just vegetables.
Lola's is always a hit and if there's a line, it's one of the few places where I will happily wait my turn.  Best bet is right around 6pm or wait until 9ish.  My guess is around $30 per person before drinks.  These folks work hard for you.The menu is limited, but their gazpacho is wonderful, and you can't go wrong with their paella. Oh, and don't forget their house-made sangria! They also have a corking fee if you want to grab a bottle of wine before you dine. (Swirl, a neat little wine bar, is right across the street.)This is my favorite restaurant in New Orleans. Their paella is amazing! I love their chocolate cake and sangria. I highly recommend Lola's! It's small so if you don't want to wait get there around 5:30pm right when it opens.Great place if you need to get away from all the Cajun/creole food of the region. We ordered the garlic mushrooms, green mussels and salad special for starters and then a small seafood paella.  We split everything and had plenty to eat for two people. I loved the sangria. Very refreshing. I embraced the smallness of the restaurant. Really fun, friendly and fantastic servers.Three of us ladies went last night. We had never dined together before so three different styles and tastes of people.  I said they were know for paella so two of us had seafood and my friend had the vegetable version.
Seafood paella was the worst my friend and I ever had. We ordered the medium size. It was over cooked  tiny bits of seafood. Dry. And tasteless. No seasoning to speak of and again dry. I would  not eaten it and left it all . But I was hungry and didn't want to waste money. Or be rude in front of my guests.    My guest said garlic soup was ok. My other guest said the garden salad was ok. And they charge a nominal fee for bread without mentioning it.   Service was good. But all three of us said we would rather spend $40 each elsewhere.Wow this place is as good as the recommendations!  It was so busy on Tuesday night we had to wait for a table for three altho the turnaround for twos is faster. The lamb chops were very delicious and the paella its good. Overall, great service and a very fun place to hang out. We will return.I think this may have been one of our favorite meals yet in New Orleans...and that's a lot of meals in NOLA over the past 13 years of visiting for business.  Can't go wrong with the Ceviche, Green Mussels, then the Lamb and Sausage/Chicken/Pork Paella with Red Sangria.  Can't wait to come back!For a food city such as New Orleans one would think that spanish restaurants would abound...not so.  A few exist but not as many as one would think.
Lola's is on Esplanade close to the Fairgrounds.  A small restaurant with atmosphere to spare.  we were in dire need of Sangria; something that is tough to find in the city in this post-K world.  They have it.  Not the best, but pretty darn good!  We started with an appetizer of Chirizo, Serrano ham and spanish cheeses...delicious!  From there we made our way toward the Cerviche.  There was nothing wrong with it but it was strictly fish and lemon juice served on a bed of romaine lettuce with diced tomatoes...it was eaten!  for the entree we split a combination Paella that had sausage, chicken, shrimp, scallops calamari and it was absolutely delicious!  Cooked to perfection...Lola's is a cool little place in a cool little neighborhood...don't expect fine dining but chill and roll!The paella's are the best I've ever had. You smell like the food once u leave and it's so tasty. You can see the kitchen and the paella are cooked on cast iron. So full of flavor and not soggy. The paella is perfection at Lola's. The shrimp appetizer is also to die for! Love love love.We've been to New Orleans a couple of times (pre-catrina) and recently a friend asked for restaurent references for there. Immediately we realized that this was our favorite. The atmosphere, friendly service (cute wait staff too) and the food were probably our best memory from this city. For all food lovers visiting the big easy, this is a must see!Loved the vegetarian paella the first time I had it.  The second time I had it, it was extremely salty.  After I stopped eating, I could lick my lips and still taste the salt.  I would like to think that's not the norm...so I'm rating this place four stars.  I was a bit bummed because I couldn't finish my plate because it was so salty.
Lentil soup was yummy and hit the spot.
I will say that for my first visit, I had a waitress who was very friendly.  Even when it was busy, she took the time to ask me if I'd like a second piece of bread.
The second visit, the waiter plopped my first piece of french bread on my plate with a "thunk".  And when I brought up that my paella was salty, he said "yes, I know it is."  I told him that it wasn't that salty the first time & he said he'd let the kitchen know.trying to find it was a little hard. its like a little hole in the wall. when we walked in we weren't greeted and when we told a waiter with an eye patch  we were a party of two he was very very rude and knowingly sat us at a disgustingly dirty table with food and wine stain dirty dishes and forks.. when we told him we would like to sit somwhere else because no had come to clean the table he got irritated and told said "sit wherever i don't care"..... other than that. we had the garlic soup which was amazing a tad salty but still great.. then we had the combination paella which has veggies seafood and meat.. it was absolutely delicious!!! i didnt have to add salt pepper or any extra seasoning to my food. and i love that.Always on the Money with product,  service and atmosphere.  We even dined here for New Years Eve and my comments held more than true.  the shrimp pasta is my fav with the crabmeat tropicale salad.  Always so fresh.  You just can't go wrong. Oh and Kid friendly.  The spoil my 8 year old and she remembers this clearly each visit.Seafood Paella was awesome. The almond suggest ice cream and flan were incredible. The salad was great. The bread was great. I would recommend this place just get there early. It kind of small but worth the wait.I don't feel like typing a long review. Place is di-lish!!!This was by far my favorite place to eat and still rates high up, but I stopped ordering the paella becuse they just do not give any amount of meat.  I still love all the other dishes, but for the price I think they could give a little more in the paellaYum!!!!  3 hours after a meal with the grandparents and my tummy is still happy.   The dark wooden chairs and simple white table cloths with the terracotta colored floors immediately reminded of fond memories of my meals in Madrid and Barcelona.  
The garlic butter spread for the pistolettes, shrimp and mushroom apps were flooded with delicious, sharp garlic.  The paellas, both seafood and meat, practically melted in mouth and were so delicately yet purposefully seasoned.  The pork tenderloin was enthusiastically inhaled by my fiance in a matter of seconds so I can't attest to its appeal.  He said it was great so I have to believe him.  We got the dessert sampler and the overall favorite was the chocolate cake.  It's flourless, dense, and insanely gratifying.  The sangria was delicious and had a nice blend of spices to add to the aftertaste and aroma.  Service was courteous, helpful and not too invasive.  
I am very sorry to hear about the original owner's recent passing.  He must be proud, wherever he is, to have such a wonderful establishment turning out such pleasant evenings as the one I had with my family tonight.Had the calamari and mushroom apps, seasonal salad, and combo Fiduea.  Everything right down to the bread and butter was ridiculously good.  Fiduea takes a little time but is sooooo worth it.  I've never had anything like it, and can't wait to go back.  And oh yeah, get the sangria.Delicious! One of the best paella dishes I've ever had! I've been to Lola's around 5 times now and it never lets me down. Every small plate and paella I've had has been delicious. Their sangria is good too! I recommend getting the grilled calamari, garlic shrimp, ceviche, and the combo paella to share!I came here two nights in a row while I was visiting new Orleans for a conference. Their vegetarian paella is one of the best things I've ever eaten!I must say I was truly hoping my friend and I could simply sit outside to enjoy the romantic breezy air tonight; but we were told that no we had to use the inside seating. The only two complaints I have here is the fact that it was unusually LOUD this evening. On the menu my friend pointed out that no more than a party of six are allowed to dine at each table but there were seven or so drunk members of a young party who were so LOUD they ruined the peaceful atmosphere and everyone was shouting above each other just to get in a word in edgewise. Another major issue that made it hard to enjoy my meal was the extremely cold and frigid temperature of the restaurant. The last time I ate here I can't ever recall it being so NOISY and RAUCOUS. Everyone here dining was challenged by this noisy party of seven and not one waiter or staff member would quiet these people down. The room temperature was freezing and the comforting mom and pop atmosphere that I once recalled was no longer applicable. I really love the food here. The paella is always prepared so well and the appetizers are fresh and creative but it's hard to enjoy your food with a friend when every customer must compete for SCREAMING SPACE. It's not peaceful to dine with such noise reverberating and echoing through a restaurant and I can't remember or recall a time when this restaurant had to crank up the AC so much. Please go back in time. People loved to come here for good food, intimate conversation and relaxing environment. The ambiance is just as important an experience as good quality food so please go back to a quieter time when people could just relax and enjoy. I miss the intimacy of the old Lola's. Don't let a few rowdy customers spoil it for everyone.  Oh yea before I forget.  I wanted an explanation of all the desserts on the menu since I was not sure of all the options.  I did order the chocolate chulaflan with my friend and I consumed most of it since I love chocolate but I was truly hoping it would be real flan and it wasn't.  This dessert is a chocolate truffle so I kind of wish there was a bit more explaining of what each dessert is prior to making up my mind.  What ever dish you choose you can't go wrong.  My main criticisms here was the NOISE level and the freezing cold temperature of the restaurant.  Both issues are major hindrances that can prevent one from fully enjoying a night out on the town.In my top 3 places to eat in NOLA!
The vegetarian paella is out of control!!  The flavors are intense and it's obviously made with love.  Let me backtrack.  We started with the sangria, not too sweet, perfect.  My friend ordered the almond soup which was incredible but she thought it was pretty filling for an appetizer.  I ordered the tasty lentil soup to start, mmm!  My friend's entree was the pesto spinach linguini and it was just as good as the paella.  I'm so glad she couldn't finish it all and let me take home her leftovers.  Oh wait, the bread that comes out before the meal is incredible.  We both thought the bread came with butter so we didn't eat it but by the looks of the reviews it's a garlic/oil spread so now I'm to go back to try it.  
It's a small place with few tables.  We came at around 8pm during the week, maybe a Wednesday, so we were able to sit right away.  I tried to come back on a Thursday but there was close an hour and a half wait so either come prepared to wait or come earlier in the week.I cant give Lola's 5 stars...yet. I've been hearing great things about this place so I finally got around to it last night and have no regrets. I wasnt the hugest fan of the calamari steak (thats the only way I can describe it) appetizer,but my date and i split a med combo pallela and it was wonderful and even after totally pigging out there was still more wow haha. The service was awesome!  Not a very big place and they dont take reservations but they were happy to serve drinks outside to those waiting. I will go back :)Everything was absolutely stellar. Food, service, atmosphere, and drinks were all top notch. If you have time, ask for a tour of the distillery. Lola's is great. 10/10 would recommend
