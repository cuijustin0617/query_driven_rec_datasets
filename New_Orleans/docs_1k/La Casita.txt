Fabulous! Best happy hour, fresh menu, Delish- drinks, if I had the time, I'd come here every day!Tacos.....
The chips and salsa were pretty lame.....and the tacos were ok.....nothing special.....Salsa is absolutely terrible. Chips are great, but man that salsa lacks any and all flavor. No salt in it, no spice, no heat. The sweet potato and pork nachos were okay. It seems like a place that's overpriced and terrible because it can be due to its location. Up your salsa game. 
******************UPDATE***********************
So I went into their location on oak street after a fun night out with my buddy and I told him "let's just go see if their salsa is any different than the other location. Plus, it was Endymion that night, so who knows. Everyone deserves a second chance."
We sit down at the bar and my buddy goes to use the restroom. Bartender asks me if we're eating, drinking, or a little of both. I told him about my previous salsa experience and he nodded. Thinking nothing of it, I go to use the restroom after my bro comes out and upon my return I have the general manager, the owner (I think?), and a chef all gathered around me to have me try their new salsa! Apparently they recognized me from my yelp profile picture, and wanted to leave a better impression. Well they most certainly did. They did something that I'm not accustomed to seeing in restaurants: they cared. 
To veer off into a tiny tangent for a second, of all the restaurants I go to, good food is usually just a percentage or part of the overall experience. You won't go into an Applebee's or Chili's expecting to be taken care of. You go in there, you lock eyes with your waiter's tired eyes, you know everything is nuked in the microwave, you order it anyways, you eat, you pay, you tip, you leave. Don't expect anything magical from Applebee's or Chili's. They don't care. It's a mechanical process that's specialized by corporate heads in nicer places to delude you into thinking you're getting great service, or at least are entitled to, but you're not. You know that. But that's now why you go there. But that's the difference between those chain restaurants and restaurants that care. So to bring my tangent back to my main point, La Casita definitely left a lasting impression on me by showing how much they care. And that's what you want in a restaurant. 
They changed their salsa and I got to try it. Now to be honest, fair, and balanced I didn't like their new salsa either. But if you're going based off of flavor, it was a thousand times better than what I experienced previously. I've worked at a Mexican restaurant where they made their salsa in house, and my tastebuds can't speak for everyone as everyone has specific things they like and dislike. I just happen to like salsa with a bit more heat, tang, and pop. But their salsa is definitely unique and improved.
Have not had an opportune chance to sit down and dine there yet, but will as soon as I can find some time! If you're in the mood for "Tex mex meets Southern California with an authentic Mexican twist" as the bartender described it, then definitely head down there and be greeted by people who want you to enjoy your experience not because they're getting paid to but, rather more importantly, because they care.Stopped in for lunch and had the special which was the LaPlaya and also had the Couchon which were both delicious in their own flavors.  The beef and shrimp were very fresh.  I was also able to try the con queso which was one of the best con quesos I have had in a while.  The chips were crunchy and hot.  The styling of the plate and presentation was unique.  Great waiters. Small venue but very nice.  I'll definitely be going back at some point for Happy Hour.Awesome tacos. Great salsas. Delicious Margaritas! Happy hour 3-7pm. Friendly and attentive staff. Ask for a swirl of Mexican vanilla in you're iced tea. It's like my Abuela is in the back cooking this stuff!Found by chance and loved right away. My burrito was excellent, wrapped in a light tortilla, with a tasty and freshly made filling and perfectly cooked rice. My husband loved his tacos, one with pork and one with carnitas. Personnel was fast and courteous. We will come back!Thank goodness for yelp because we would've never found this place without it. It's a little hole in the wall place very charming. We happened to come on happy hour which was a great bargain we had two drinks and dinner for a little over $20 Great guacamole and simple tacos were just what we needed. Shinon the bartender was helpful and accommodating.Excellent service!! Great happy hour deal!! I only tried the chips and guacamole this time, but I will be back to try more. Fresh and delicious food.We used to go here quite a bit, but haven't been in a few months.  The food and service was always great in the past.  Today the service was completely horrible.  The margarita was the worst I've ever had.  The whole bottom of the glass was covered in salt.  It wasn't drinkable and the server didn't offer to make me another one or to take it off the bill.  The server had a really hard time taking our order.  He was probably new because he didn't know the menu.  He dropped off our food, but left the table so fast that we couldn't even ask for sauce for our tacos.  He didn't come back to check on us until after we were finished eating.  The food was okay, but very bland without sauce.  Very disappointing.Do not go here if you are looking for a value for your money.  Their Tres Quesos comes in a tiny container around the size of mashed potatoes that you get from popeyes.  No lie.  It's $11.00 
ELEVEN DOLLARS FOR CHIPS AND  DIP!!!!   Those chips better be dusted in gold for that price in my opinion!  To add insult to injury there are no prices on their menus.  Is this because they are too ashamed of their horrendous prices?Outstanding all around. Fresh salsa and great service for our party of 9. A must if you want Mexican while in NOLANew Orleans isn't a great Mexican food town but I do come here because their queso is awesome and they have a great happy hour. ($2 simple tacos/$4 margs/$5 sangria) I love that they don't use commercial mixes for their margs - they actually make the syrups and mixes themselves.
Watch out for their seasonal specials - when they have watermelon salsa, you must get whatever they are pairing with it. And if you have a sweet tooth, the hazelnut avocado mousse is fantastic.
Pro-tips: the back patio is awesome for al fresco dining. If you need to charge your phone, the bartender will totally hook you up!Back on my taco binge, I had to find a new place to get my fixing. I like this little place, a lot. Came in on a Wednesday night around 8 o'clock to a dimly lit, friendly-faced, moderately occupied restaurant. We were able to grab a table right away and considering it was such a nice night, we decided to step out back to dine in the courtyard.
There's plenty of seating here, they've done well with the tight warehouse district space. Our server was friendly, but the service was standard. I remember it taking a moment to get our orders together as they input them using an iPad. Seems their U.I. could use a little upgrade for user friendliness.
Margaritas were pretty good, I usually get headaches from em' but I also didn't pound four of them. For the app we got the tres queso (didn't add any meat) which was nice. Came with a ton of chips and you're gonna want to get at that queso fast because we all know what happens when we let it sit for a few minutes. I would have liked a little more of a spicy kick in the queso tho, but I'd get them again.
My date ordered the sweet potato quesadilla witch she (and i) liked a lot, careful tho because they come out HOT! I went with the fuego burrito with a salad and that thing was massive! It's rare that I have to box up a meal but I had to, I would've died trying to put it all away that night. It could have been all the chips I decimated also.
The two of us ate for about $30 or so, not a bad deal. I can see myself returning for more, we were very pleased with the food.
One more thing, my date had been here before and they charged her for something that was wrong, so long story short, she was told that they would put her name in "the book" and they would take care of it next time. Well folks, there is no "the book" so if it happens to you, don't fall for it. Get something written from management.
****UPDATE****
My date clarified that there IS in fact a book. My Apologies to any staff affected.
11/10/2015Amazing food,  cute little restaurant. The staff was very very nice too. Had to leave a review!I wish they wouldn't price gouge people during Mardi Gras.  Last year, I watched a parade by them and it was over $20, including tip, for a margarita and 2 tiny tacos.  These are the same tacos that cost $2 during happy hour, but they do away with happy hour on parade night and charge $5 per taco and at least $10 for a margarita (normally $4).  For me, I would appreciate if they kept their regular happy hour deal or even regular prices, and weren't so blatantly ripping me off like a tourist.  They would get more of my business if they weren't so greedy.  Now, I'm specifically avoiding them.Amazing fresh and tasty seafood burrito. Place is pretty non-descript. Service was fairly bad. (Server first told me they couldn't make a daiquiri, then left her shift without telling anyone.) 
Manager spoke to us and was very interested in our input. I asked if they just opened because the ambiance was sparse and service was weak. She replied that the restaurant was two years old, but that it was hard to keep good help. 
Plate was bare of anything except my burrito. That needs some work too.  Prices are probably too low.
Burrito was excellent, flavorful, interesting, well balanced, lots of shrimp. The rest of the experience needed some work.My friend was in town and we were looking for a good Mexican place to eat that wasn't a bit of a drive - So I found this business on Yelp, the four star review sold me so we decided to go! We didn't get any apps but both of us got tacos (I got two a-la-carte and she got a dinner). I opted for the Cochon de Mexicana ($4) and the  Hasta La Vegan ($4). I started off with the Hasta la Vegan and it was ok - I think I didn't like the grilled corn tortilla but all the insides (Portabellas, roasted cord, radishes, pico de gallo and avocado) was fresh and yummy. Once I took a bite into the Cochon de Mexicana and actually said "OMG I AM SO GLAD WE CAME HERE" the Mexican style pork was juicy and delicious, the picked cabbage was purple and yummy and the ancho crema was delish.
The only reason why they got 4 stars is because my friend got her dish about 3-4 minutes before me (they were still assembling my tacos when her's were delivered). They don't have lemon for the Iced tea...but lime in the tea was pretty yummy. 
Overall I spent about $11 for two tacos and a tea.Was visiting from California and it was Tuesday, so naturally I was craving some tacos. Looked up this place which had $2 tacos and $4 margaritas during happy hour so that already deserves one star in itself. 
We were seated in the back patio which had really cute decor and lighting. Only drawback is that I feel like we were sometimes forgotten about back there. Not to mention the waiter seemed super flustered. Which, I get it, it's happy hour, but there's no shame in writing down our order to make sure you get it right. 
Ended up getting a few tacos and chips with guac and queso dip for the table. Carnitas was great but the tortillas were not top notch. Maybe I'm just a CA taco snob, idk. I heard the guy from the table next to me ask the waiter what carnitas was so maybe Mexican food isn't the specialty around here... The guac and queso dip were both top notch though so extra points for that.
Would definitely recommend this place to a fellow out of towner looking for some good Mexican food or for anyone looking for a solid happy hour.Went for happy hour. Ordered the simple tacos. Delicious! My friend is vegetarian and ordered the veggie tacos. She loved them. The taco fillings were substantial. For $2 they hit the spot. Also ordered the guacamole. Couldn't stop dipping and adding it to the tacos. The sangria was refreshing and went well with the tacos. Will go again for happy hour specials!Finally a great taco spot! I'll stop being a grump now.La Casita on first glance looks like it would be a fantastic little Mexican joint, but there was plenty of disappointments on my visit. The service is pretty lousy. I found myself sitting with an empty glass far too often for my liking. The bathroom was filthy, and doubled as a storage closet for the restaurant. There was trash on the floor and it was pretty dirty in general. The food was not too good as well. I had the mission tacos, which were shrimp tacos with a pickled slaw and avocado. The slaw greatly overpowered the fresh Louisiana shrimp, what a shame. My combo came with rice and beans, and they were anything but spectacular. The rice was boring and the beans were salty with no flavor. I would not recommend this to anyone, the restaurant really needs to revamp the food, service, and bathrooms.Excellent service - delicious food!!   Easy walk from area hotels and shopping- totally worth it.    Casual atmosphere with good tunes and great drink selections!
Wish this place was in Dallas so I could enjoy more often!   Chicken tacos were deliciousCozy atmosphere. Great Happy Hour specials. Strong Margaritas and amazing tacos. Must try Guac and chips!On a hot day we popped in for a quick drink after visiting the Southern Art Museum nearby. We took a seat at the bar and were greeted right away. The place is very upscale, prices for drinks seemed a little high. I went for a Strawberry Marg which was about $10 but it was absolutely delicious. The two girls who were behind the bar gave us some good ideas for other things to explore while in town. Their menu looked pretty tempting, might have to try their tacos next time we are in town.Simple tacos with amazing flavor.  Loved the guac and margaritas too.  Highly recommended.I owe all the credit for this one to the Yelp NOLA crew. I was staying at the Lafayette Hotel and wanted Mexican food without having to walk too far, saw this was nearby and stopped in. Its a small place, but I instantly felt welcomed by the waitstaff. We walked in just in time for Happy Hour so we took FULL advantage. I ordered the Margarita ($4) and my co-worker ordered the Mojito ($5) and then we decided to try the chips and with guac, salsa, and queso. DELICIOUS and very filling! As if that wasn't enough, we went in for round 2 with drinks (naturally, it's New Orleans and a Wednesday, why not?) and ordered the Pork and Sweet Potato Quesadillas to split. OH MY. One of the best quesadillas I've ever had. The succulent pork was a perfect complement to the sweetness of the potatoes and then add Manchego, one of my favorite cheeses, and a spicy smooth ancho chile sauce and you've got a winner!
If I'm in the Warehouse District any time soon, I'll be headed back to La Casita for sure! Next time I want to try their tacos...They don't usually take reservations, but saved us a table for six for my wife's birthday.  We accidentally ended up there during their happy hour from 3 PM to 7 PM every day. It was a great atmosphere, and the food was very good. Wait staff was very attentive to our needs.Bought a Mardi Gras package online. Don't do this save your $$. For the amount of money you could feed 4 people plus drinks! Felt very ripped off. Buyer beware!Great staff and location! The happy hour deal for tacos you cannot beat! The tacos are fantastic and the meat is so tender. They source some of their meats from two-run farm among other local ingredients.We came here with two small children, which I don't recommend, but they were nice and accommodating anyway. Going to a not family oriented place with two little girls can be quite a task. The place is tiny and probably best for a girls night or drinks post work day for happy hour. They were close to the children's museum and made a good spot for an early post play date dinner. 
My friend is vegan and allergic to onions and the waitstaff was patient and very attentive to make sure she was happy and avoided cross contamination on her veggie tacos. The girls enjoyed chips and queso, as well as a cheese quesadilla. I loved the queso. I don't identify with the velveeta comments I have seen on other reviews. It was comparable to Felipe's queso, with a nice amount of chopped fresh jalapeño on top. The chips may not have been house made but we're really good too. My sweet potato and pork quesadilla was great but very messy. I had to eat it with a fork because of the mass amount of goopy mashed sweet potatoes inside. I disliked my pork taco. I love carnitas and judge a taco spot by their pork. It has that strong almost gamey flavor that pork can get when over cooked, reheated or under seasoned. I haven't had this problem with many other taco places in town. The wait staff was definitely busy, but very efficient. We never had to ask for something or wait to be taken care of. Our check was only $30 for the 4 of us. We skipped drinks in the interest of parent mode but I wanted to try a margarita. 
Will I go out of my way to stop here again? No. 
Will I consider it if I'm in the area? Yes! But mostly for the sweet potato and pork quesadilla. It was the highlight of our visit.I love that so many new places are opening close to me... this being one of them.  I was thrilled when I discovered them while looking for something to do for Cinco de Mayo.  Sadly though, they aren't open on Sunday's.
Cocktails: the sangria needs help but the margarita was close to perfection.
Food:  simple tacos fixin's were great but the tortilla needs help; the queso got hard pretty quick and the chips were nothing special... just your average tortilla chips
Wait staff:  Very attentive and sweet
Atmosphere: it's small but I like small places; well decorated and has a nice courtyard but that could use a little sprucing up
I really hope this place makes it.  They are on my way home and would love it to be a regular thing. I'll come back later and update my review.Love their happy hour.  The margaritas rock!!!! and the mojitos are yummy too.   They have amazing $2 tacos and its half off guacomole, salsa, queso.  My family and I can't decide which one is better because everyone in my family have a different favorite.  The only thing that could be better about the place is to liven up the courtyard a bit. Maybe add some more plants and some lights strung across for more ambiance.  Over all love this place.Great burrito featuring the best of Mexican cuisine. The food lets the ingredients do the talking rather than being overloaded by sauces, cheeses, and dips. Service is attentive, and it is an overall wonderful experience.LOVED the salsa -- absolutely fresh -- not too hot, not too mild.  
The brisket taco was to die for.  No, really.  It is, hands down, the best taco I have had in Louisiana.  
I also enjoyed the fresh, home-cooked pinto beans.  
We had pleasant, attentive and efficient service.I love this little place! We went here with a group for happy hour. I'll admit it is a little small but they have have a back patio, had it not been freezing we could have sat out there. I loved our waitress, Heidi.  She was very accommodating with our chaoticness that we brought. She willingly moved tables around to make space for us and she separated checks for us! She was on top of our orders without ever writing them down. I had the sangria which is a white sangria and it was yunmy. Dont eat the fruit in there unless you are really prepared ;-) the sweet potatoe and pork quesadilla was really good. My hubby got the gigantic burrito which puts izzos illegal burritos size to shame. The guac was half off but there was so much of it! And the queso had a kick to it plus there was pulled pork in it. I will be back!Best tacos I've had in a long time. The service was speedy, and the staff friendly. The chips and salsa weren't anything special, but I didn't go there for that. 
Yummy, and I'll be back.This was a gem of a find. Best burrito I've had in a long time. 
We arrived with a large group of 12 people and were seated in a booth across from the bar. The server was very attentive and made sure we were taken care of right away. 
The food was amazing. Everyone in our group loved their order. Even the kids ate everything they were served. 
Will definitely be going back here next time we are in NOLA!Awesome happy hour! 2$ domestics and 1/2 off guacamole. Good service and nice atmosphere.review is only based on a walk in and out experience. It was packed, which I don't mind. you have to go to the bar to order, not my thing. we left. very small place tooOk. Who goes to New Orleans for Mexican food? A vegetarian of course. This place is great.  The guacamole they make fresh. The cheese dip is hot served at the table, the salsa is yummy and has chunks of avocado in it. 
I got there before 7 pm so the veggie tacos were on special. 
The place was full, people were really into a Saints game. 
Warm friendly atmosphere. 
Recommended.Excuse my French, but Holy Shit, Shove Me In It... La Casita's Hazelnut Avocado Mousse just made sweet, sweet love to my taste buds and kissed me on the forehead whilst whispering sweet nothings and slipped away into the afternoon like a dream...(btw- Heidi is a local treasure)After one Wednesday at the Square we were roaming the Warehouse District when this heavenly aroma directed us to La Casita.  
* Picturesque. 
* Quaint. 
* Cozy. 
In other words very small inside but quite charming. We sat at the bar and decided to start with a couple of top shelf margaritas'. The bartender was not the friendliest, as a matter of fact she appeared to be either quite put out that customers had arrived, or she just had no personality. We'll go with no personality. After being ignored, apparently for not ordering immediately as our asses hit the seat, we finally were spoken to, and were able to place an order.
* Margaritas. Excellent.
* Tacos. Tasty but very, very, very small. 
I hope this wasn't indicative of La Casita's standard fare. Our first impression was that we liked the placed but it was quite pricey for such measly portions (and we aren't huge portion lovers - yet these left a lot to be desired). I will say the tacos didn't appear to be as advertised on menu!! Later after checking out Yelp- believe me the food wasn't up to any of the rave reviews. Our experience that night would say - skip the food. BUT, as La Casita has received many first-rate reviews, our margaritas' were excellent, AND the aroma (which is how we landed there) was divine, we plan to give it another go in future.Found this place and I'm so glad we did. Make sure to stop in at happy hour for $5 margaritas which were delicious. They also have $2 tacos and other great deals. Coming from a Latino family, I think that this food tasted pretty authentic, especially the rice and the chips and guacamole. If you're not up for tacos and want to try something lighter, the chipotle Caesar salad is fantastic. It doesn't really taste like a Cesar salad, but it had a great creamy and spicy taste. I just tried that from someone else's plate but it was my favorite. All this great food, combined with really friendly and fast service and a hip atmosphere makes this a must visit place if you're looking for a break from Cajun cuisine.New Mexican place of which there are very few in Nola especially downtown. Good, fresh rice; not dry and clumpy. Same for tortillas. Very good, fresh food overall. Happy hour looks to be decent also.Great margs, and the sweet potato quesadilla was very tasty!!! I'll be back!Fun hip little place specializing in specialty tacos. The menu beyond that is very limiting but if you like tacos give it a try. They are ala cart style so you can mix and match flavors. The salsa are HOT so use caution before piling it on. The pineapple salad was larger than expected and was meh. Nice selections of beers and drinks. The two issues I had was the pace. The entrees took about 40 minutes to come out after the salads and the place was not busy. The tacos are simple and basic so not sure what took so long. And the music was cranked would have been nicer to have it a little quieter. But all in all I would go again.I'm from San Francisco and grew up eating tacos in the mission district my whole life. These tacos hold up to anything I can find in the city! So fresh, flavorful and creative l! I highly recommend this place to scratch your taco itch. The happy hour menu is not to be missed either. I'll be back to explore some delicious sounding drink creationsHH prices are awesome! My group enjoyed our tacos, margaritas and mojitos - no complaints on the food especially for the price. Small interior so the five of us had to sit in the patio in the back - so not ideal for a large group.Excellent food and service. The taco combination platter allows you to choose among a bevy of fresh local ingredients. The accompanying beans and rice are perfectly seasoned. Don't miss happy hour.Absolutely perfect!  We just wanted a quick, inexpensive snack and their tacos were excellent!  Hasta la vegan, veggie and shredded chicken were just great!  Margarita was delicious and the service was wonderful.Chill spot. -
Hanna the miss behind the bar made me a few tasty drinks and served us food. 
Delicious shrimp burrito
quality queso dip.
Great happy hour place in the CBDIt is an insult to call this Mexican food. Flavorless and expensive for what it is. Really not good.
I understand you are busy and that is a good problem to have.  Unfortunately when I walk in and everything is out, if you start scrambling to find some ingredients to fill the void, the end result is changed.  We had the Fuego and Cachon, which we decided on because you where out of beans. So beans and avocados are 86, which makes perfect sense, why have two of the biggest staples of the cultures cuisine. The Fuego meat was not bad, but the cheese goo (you where out of Monterey Jack cheese) was bad. The Cachon meat had no flavor, the rice in both burritos lack seasoning and was under cooked. Also the pickled cabbage, if pickled, was not good. 
On top of it all the waitress was not seen after someone else dropped off our food. The bright spot the salad with pineapple dressing was good.  Unfortunately you only get one chance for a first impression, my impression was I was robbed. So you won't get another chance, but I hope you can improve and what other reviewers have said is true. IGreat little place for guac and chips and tacos.  Ive had tacos all over the place, Mex too, and these were really good, some of the best.  Waitress was extremely nice and helpful with the menu.  Prices are a bit high but totally worth it.  Happy hour is probably the time to go.  I went early on a Sunday and not crowded.  Enjoy!!Loved the quiet atmosphere and very reasonable prices. Two simple tacos for $10. I could only eat one! Decent margarita during happy hour for $4. Wait staff very friendly and informative about local music venues.In town for a few days and yelp did not disappoint in helping chose excellent spots. 
This is a cool little hole in the wall. Great margaritas. Excellent chips and salsa. And the house tacos were unique but expertly crafted with fresh ingredients and a great play of favors.I was searching for local restaurants away from the tourists traps during my visit to NOLA, and happily Yelp led me to La Casita. This tiny restaurant is small but mighty. There were only a few tables in addition to a large bar, but thankfully there was a table available when we arrived. Our server was attentive but not overbearing, and gave us a very knowledgeable run-down of their menu offerings. The drinks were strong, tasty, and reasonably priced. We started with the Tres Quesos, which was great. Between the two of us we tried all four of their specialty tacos, and all of them were winners. I especially enjoyed the Cochon de Mexicana. If you're going to add rice and beans to your meal, I recommend splitting it with your companions. The tacos were surprisingly filling. Overall, a great experience!I can't say enough about this place. Amazing margaritas, amazing tacos. Tiffany provided us with the best service. She kept the drinks and the queso coming. I will definitely be back here!!This place is one of my favorites in the CBD if I'm craving tacos and margaritas. Slightly pricy if you don't come during happy hour but so worth it. I love the del fuego tacos and queso! It far surpasses the 2 nearby Mexican places in my opinion. They have a private courtyard in the back and tables near the front French doors which make the atmosphere refreshing and quant.I eat out...A LOT. Finding a good happy hour in New Orleans can sometimes be challenging and I stumbled onto this place by accident. Happy hour is great. As a waitress at a very popular restaurant uptown, I am constantly critiquing other people's customer service skills ( not in a pompous way, but that's just what you do in the industry). Kevin, our waiter, was top 3 I have ever had in this city. Absolutely wonderful. He was fun, attentive, and when I asked a question he gave me a definitive, no nonsense answer (the generic "what do you like better" kind of question). I really like waiting tables as I generally like most people and I know that can be difficult when you are serving for a living but I got the sense that he does too. If he doesn't, then he is EXTRA good at his job.  My shrimp burrito was delicious, guac was super fresh, salsa was delicious but you can get stellar food at so many places here that I usually don't write reviews on the food alone. In fact, the only other review I have written was because the service was deplorable. I figured I should make up for that by commending an absolute gem to the service industry. Kevin, if I open a restaurant in this town, I'm poaching your ass. You are superb.Queso with barbecue!! The burritos are huge & require a to go bag!! 
Cochon de Mexicana - had 2 as tacos
Our slow roasted Mexican Style pork, pickled cabbage, avocado, & ancho crema, served on a flour tortilla.
El Fuego as a burrito!
Shredded Brisket, pico de gallo, salsa verde, and flame-torched Monterey jack cheese on corn tortillas.Bartender was friendly. Server was somewhat slow. 
I got the chicken taco and after reading some reviews, the cochon. Chicken one was so bland and definitely not worth the money. The cochon was good but still, something was missing. Definitely not all it's cracked up to be. Plus they were small. After looking at other photos I realize now I didn't have the salsa verde on my plate either. 
Also, I hate when places charge for chips and salsa. 
The best thing I had was my beer!Came in for happy hour because the deals are great. $2 tacos and half off queso, $5 mojitos...who doesn't love that? My stomach that's who...got home and had terrible stomach issues. Called the following day and they said, "they would investigate and call me back." Never got a phone call back. I'm all for good service but we were nagged every 5 minutes to order our food. Was impressed my first time I went but disappointed in the second time. Won't be backA little gem among all the Art Galleries on Julia St. After a stroll through the galleries a group of us ended up at La Casita. It is a very nice, small establishment that prides on all their original food ideas. Had the guacamole and queso with chips. They were both to die for. The guacamole was fresh made and very chunky. It made for a delicious texture and a must if you go visit. The queso was creamy and had a great kick to it, not sure what type of hot pepper it was made with.
And then we get to their tacos. I had a combo of The Mission and the Cochon de Mexicana with some rice and beans. Both tacos were delicious and very well made.
Hands down I will be visiting this place again. Monday's is Margarita Night and Tuesdays are Taco Night.They wouldn't honor the lunch special price even though they were advertising it for at least 2 weeks after I went (they said the special had ended.) 
I had a couple chicken tacos, which were okay. Not much flavor in the meat and covered under a mountain of onion. Not a whole lot to enjoy about my visit. The service was friendly enough though.I was in town for a few days and was using yelp to scope out places to eat. This was the best place we ate at by far. 
Their happy hour special is great. Highly recommend. Plus with corn shell tacos they are gluten free!Happy hour margaritas and simple tacos?  Yes please!  We were in New Orleans for a girl's trip and really wanted Mexican one night, so we decided on La Casita.  The place was so good that we came back the next day for happy hour again.  I would say that the best taco was the El Fuego.  It has shredded brisket, pico, salsa verde.  It is covered in jack cheese then flame torched.  But honestly, everything that I had was very good and very well seasoned.  We also ordered the 3 cheese queso and the guacamole for the table, and both tasted great.  Out of the two, I liked he guacamole the best.  The margaritas were also very good.  I had both the watermelon and the lime for happy hour.  My friend had the pineapple cilantro rita, and she said it was one of the best she has every had.  If you haven't been to this place, you should go!This place is pretty good for some tacos! As stated in other reviews, I am pretty picky. I just get the tacos with meat only....but they're still great! I usually get the rice and beans, as well. The rice is a hit or miss; sometimes it's good other times not so much. Last time I went, it was overseasoned and undercooked. The beans, on the other hand, are always very good. I really like the queso a lot, and the guacomole is not bad, either. I highly recommend the carnitas taco. I also like the brisket taco.  All of the servers are very friendly and efficient.Great food! Laid back atmosphere... Casual dining. Court yard seating. Great Sangrias but watch out it won't take much...This place is so cute. Margaritas were great ,the guacamole fantastic and the tacos yummy. The bartender was very friendly and attentive and knowledgeable. She suggested the brisket and the Carnitas tacos. They did not disappoint very very good. Definitely must go eat here will not disappoint!Friends of mine and I have eaten here several times. We have never be a bad meal. All of the ingredients are very fresh and the owner John Michael is super accommodating.  This is a great pre-Saints game hot spot.First date was here the night before thanksgiving. We've been back many times. The ambiance is low key and personal thus  Highly recommended for the occasion of a first date.  The happy hour is great and worth making time for. $4 margaritas and $2 tacos so you are not breaking the bank if it doesn't work out.Amazing guacamole.  Awesome salsa.
I had a crawfish taco (when in NoLa) and it rocked!!
The owner was so nice.  The place is really cute.
Loved it!!Nothing special. Also happy hour deal of  $2 domestic beer is total lie. I ordered the NOLA beer - the place is in New Orleans, to be precise-, could not get any domestic than thar, and they charged me $9. Hey, i am  a tourist, suck my blood dude...
Quick update: same beer, just $5 on le petite grocery's menu, one of the hippest places. Really? Did you need to steal those a few dollars from me? Pathetic.First off - for what this restaurant is, it is good, just not excellent. Fresh ingredients and good flavors. We saw the guacamole on another review and ordered it - it was okay, nice and creamy with jalapenos, but nothing outstanding. We happened to be there for happy hour, which means $2 tacos. For the value, the tacos were good. The special taco of the day was a brisket with jalapeno and a spicy sauce - the best one of all the tacos we ordered (also got chicken and the regular brisket tacos). Our waiter was excellent - very attentive and helpful. The margarita was just okay. I would not go out of my way to come back here, but if you are a looking for a quick taco stop in the warehouse district, this is your place.You absolutely cannot beat the happy hour here! Frankly, I would go back for the tacos and pay full price. The guacamole was chunky and had decent flavor, and the portion size was decent! We sampled all of the simple tacos, which are $2 during happy hour. There was a ton of meat (or veggies, i.e. cabbage) in each, so we separated the two tortillas and made two tacos! My favorite was the chicken, with the brisket coming in a close second. I am not a big fan of queso, but my husband is. I would have to say that it was pretty decent, and the portion of chips that came out with it was quite generous. The margaritas were quite sour. I liked them, but my husband was not a fan. I have a feeling it all depends on what limes are being squeezed and who is putting the mixture together. I was happy he didn't like his because I got it! 
I do have to say that my seven year old pointed out that this isn't real Mexican food, meaning she couldn't get enchiladas. I'd say go in thinking cool taco/burrito shack!
In regards to the service, it was quick and efficient. Somehow our margarita order was lost, so we didn't get them until we were half way through the meal; however, our server realized it before we had to say anything. We frankly were to busy gobbling up the guac to care too much. 
In all, I would highly recommend checking this place out, even if it is for pre-dinner drinks. =)Best salsa I've ever had! The tacos were amazing too! I had a great dinner here and if you're staying in the warehouse district this place is an easy walk. I would have given five stars but I had to keep asking for stuff that should be a given. We didn't get plates, silverware, or napkins. I had to ask the bartender for silverware and I got two forks from him lol one of them a steak fork and try eating side dishes with that. So even though our waitress was a sweetheart the restaurant needs better service but I would still go back. The food was that good.Located in the Arts (Warehouse) District, this small restaurant has an attractive exterior and interior, with a focus on its bar and nightlife. We ordered the Pulled Pork Burrito and the Shrimp Taco. Both were not exactly excellent, but very good. The waitress was pleasant and prompt. I'd go, again. Prices were in line with this part of New Orleans (section of downtown). RJTBest Mexican spot for a quick taco and drink. Small quaint restaurant. Very good for happy hours!The menu here had common Mexican choices with deliciously uncommon ingredients. It was a delicious meal without being too heavy. I had la playa taco with shrimp and their house spinach salad with pineapple. I definitely recommend eating here!Yummy street tacos, margaritas half price 4 to 7, nice crowd in the middle of the warehouse district in NoLa
