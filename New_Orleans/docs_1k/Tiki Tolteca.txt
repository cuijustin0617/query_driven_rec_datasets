***YES***YES***YES***I***LOVE***LOVE***LOVE***
Oh yes,
the scorpion bowl, the piña colada (as I never drunk it before), fried shrimp taco and the Jell-O-Shots/gummy tiki cocktails ( which is an ounce of distilled spirit or any cocktail converted into a gummy bear) we had the pineapple and rum one. :-) :-) :-) all orders were delicious !!!
........ All served by a very friendly bar mixer!
The interior is fun and has its own interpretation of a Tiki bar, my two girl-friends and me had a fantastic evening.
there is no more to say then: 
YES YES YES I LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!!!
Perfect for a group of friends or a romantic date. Everything is right!!! Don't miss it if you are living in New Orleans or visiting. 
The French Quarter Tiki bar is small enough to keep an intimate ambience, and big enough to party with your friends. 
Beautiful-Non-Commercial!!!
Tiki Tolteca would become one of my regular hangout, if I were a New Orleaner :-)
Enjoy!!! :-)Great place to go after work for industry people with a 11-2 happy hour. Def recommend the one-two punch and what an asprin!I love everything about this place. Great vibes and great bartenders. What more can you ask for? I would recommend spinning the wheel to choose what drink you get. Each spin/drink cost $10 but there are 3 chances to get a free shots or a free drink. Seems like a better deal unless you land on smirnoff ice. 
We tried all 3 gummy bears and my favorite was the mai tai. The drinks here aren't too overly sweet which I was afraid of. 
FYI - this place is above felipes. You will have to go through the staircase in the back to find this hidden gem.We walked into this bar last night - December 12th,  after we were refused service at another bar because of our group size.
The bartender, who's name I didn't get, didn't blink an eye.  He made cocktails - and put on show - right down to the mocktail we ordered. 
We were out looking for an amazing cocktail experience and he delivered.I really want to like this place; they have a really cool concept with interesting drinks; however the excitement stops there. But because of the service, and the environment the rude bartenders create, I will never go back. I went recently with a group of girls celebrating a bachelorette party. This was at the beginning of the night, none of us were drunk, we're all a little bit older, so we were very quiet and tame, as far as groups of girls go. 
The bartenders were nothing but rude to all of us. I hate nothing more than an entitled bartender. You're in the service industry... in the quarter... Anyway, the bride to be wanted a picture at each bar she went to, and we asked the bartender in a nearly empty bar if he could either take a picture or be in the picture, and his responses were beyond rude. 
Also, my friend asked for change for a $20, and the bartender completely forgot, and made her sit and wait for 15 minutes while he did other things. My friend just patiently waited. and when the bartender realized he forgot, he wasn't even apologetic. 
Don't waste your money on this place, go to Latitude 29 where the bartenders are nice and accommodating, the drinks are better at Latitude anyway in my opinion.Has great cocktails and the atmosphere is spot on music and all....very laid back and chill if you want to get away from all the craziness from all the tourist.Why a tiki bar in New Orleans? So, first, are you a Lonely Planet person or a Fodor's?  If you're the former, I think I've already said enough. But seriously, this is a great find.  Maxton, chief bartender and the bar manager, came from French 75 and was nominated for a James Beard Award last , year, and is an awesome craft cocktail mixologist. Ask for an S.O.S. cocktail If you like rum or, honestly, even if you don't.  No sh*t, it's a nice, stiff, cocktail that's not overly sweet. Also ask for the St. L'orange. It's not only a great cocktail but there's also a cool story behind it involving a cat. Mostly, come here for a great vibe, easy going people, and, of course, great cocktails. You've got to find it first, though. I'll leave that up to the other reviewers.I don't really want to tell people about this place, but this place is da bomb!!! Maxton Kennedy, a James beard nominee, makes phenomenal drinks, is easy on the eyes, and super friendly. Come here for bachelorette parties, special occasions, or just because!! I feel like I work here and am trying to advertise, but I'm not, my fiancé were just walking by looking for an awesome place to have some amazing drinks at a non-pretentious place, and we we found it!!!Stopped by on a visit to New Orleans. Liked the atmosphere. The bartenders were knowledgeable about the large variety of tiki drinks and helpful in selecting. The only downside is their small beer selection. I love cocktails but my bf is a beer drinker and there wasn't much to choose from. Can't fault them too much because it's a cocktail bar. I'd definitely check it out if in New Orleans and want to try something different than a slushy on the street!This is a must-go tiki bar. The bartender obviously cares about his craft of creating a fantastic tiki experience. Top notch drinks, excellent presentation, a fun atmosphere that makes you want to stay for another drink, and a playlist that completes the whole experience. This place will become a regular stop on our future trips to New Orleans.Take a ride up on the Elevator of Doom to an amazing hidden tiki paradise right above the French Quarter! Or just take the entirely non terrifying stairs if you are feeling squeamish. Either way the drinks are a slice Tiki heaven and well worth the journey. My wife and I visited with a friend last week and tried several of their signature beverages including the Last Guinea Pig, the Seaward, the Painkiller, as well as their takes on the Aku Aku Zombie and the Mai Tai. We didn't get to try our luck on the Wheel of Drinks (winner gets a Scorpion Bowl which is a super value, the loser a malt liquorY Smirnoff Ice). The bartender, Brian is exceptionally knowledgable on his tiki drinks, and he even let us taste test a new secret concoction which was fantastic and aromatic which may soon make an appearance here. Great decor, great ambience, and great music (whether you dig surf or Slayer they got it all) compliment a selection of seriously delicious cocktails. Hope to come back soon.This place is absolutely unbelievable. We got a Painkiller and a King Thistle and they were both amazing. We also got the gummies, which were also delicious. Super friendly bartender, super cute decor - do yourself a favor and pay this place a visit.The bar itself is beautiful.
We looked at a menu..
Can we try the wheel of happenstance?
- We don't have it.
Can we try the gummis?
- I don't have those in.
May I buy a postcard to send?
- We don't do that anymore.
So one entire side of the menu was void, admittedly the part that brought us in. The bartender was less than engaged. We wont be back and this place honestly couldn't care any less.I'm not a big bar-hop, but if I lived in NOLA, I would frequent this place. I rally liked the look and the drinks.The update to my review reflects my recent conversation with business owner Pike. Not only was he willing to remedy and address bartender on his approach towards patrons inquiries. 
I was invited back to make sure this time around my experience withstood the highest expectations that the Tolteca family has of its staff and products.
Unfortunately Im not a local and will need to take a rain check on that offer. But do appreciate the effort on managements behalf to ensure customers are happy. 
Love the effort!Loved it here. Been meaning to come here for awhile. The bartender whose name I forgot to ask was amazing. Literally the only save after my experience downstairs and the only reason I'll ever eat at Felipe's again. We spent several hours here and had half a dozen drinks and some shots and gummies. We only left because if we stayed we were going to spend another hundred bucks. Honestly, will come back but 75% of the reason to see the bartender again. 
A year later.... wow. What happened to you guys? You guys updated the menu again by removing more items. It didn't exactly speed up the service. The best thing about the place is Michael, which was the only reason we came back, and to our dismay got stuck in a booth. Not that it mattered, he was so overworked and understaffed he wouldn't have been chatty and witty anyway. Another guy was there. Red shirt. Middle aged. Clearly worked there. I use that term loosely. He was only interested in other tables, literally every single other table besides ours until we ordered a $40 drink. Then we warranted passing attention. Shame it took thirty minutes to get that drink and another fifteen for the second and final drink. Seriously, get more staff. I'll probably be back but I'll call ahead to see who's working and if there's not room at the bar, I'll just go to Lucy's on Tchoupitoulas. They not only have great bartenders but they have the support staff necessary to run a bar. Michael, if you quit and go somewhere else - let us know; we'll follow you anywhere, even to The Saint.Hot buttered rum was delicious. Love the atmosphere. We are from SF and have a great selection of tiki bars there, but tiki tolteca gives them a run for their money! Great find on a rainy Sunday night and Sierra was super friendly!So glad we found this place!!! We went back two nights in a row hehe We went on a Sunday and Monday night and both nights were very mellow. The decor is awesome with tiki heads along the walls and tropical curtains. The drinks were the best we had the whole time we were in NOLA. They're a great mixture of rums- bitter, sweet, or spicy depending on your liking; and, they all come in varying tiki glasses. Our to go cups were shrunken heads (this a limited time thing). Prices were great for what you got ($7-$11). You HAVE to get the tiki gummies! We got all 3 flavors, and boy do they sneak up on you! Bartenders were all awesome. We will definitely be back in the future!Excellent drinks. Tiki drinks aren't typically my thing, but these are very good.  All of the standards that you've heard of before, but made with care and not just pumped out of a slushie machine.  
The staff has been super friendly on the two occasions that I have been here, but they can get quickly over worked.  If you have a few people with you, you are better off ordering all of your drinks together.  They seem to make things faster in groups.  
It's a pretty chill bar, dark and fairly quiet.  A place that you would go for some conversation and drinks.Eh. Cool ambiance. Rude bartender. Okay drinks... maybe go on a busier night........ maybe.4.5 rounding up.
It was Day 3 of our self-guided tour of NOLA cocktail bars, and tonight was reserved for tiki. Although we first stopped at a more famous tiki establishment next door, we were told by the surly hostess there that we weren't allowed to wait for a spot at the bar, so we left and came here instead. Well, there were plenty of seats at the bar at Tiki Tolteca, which I didn't really understand because this is A Very Cool Place.
This bar will always hold a special place in my heart because it was here that I discovered my love for tiki drinks. You see, although I've always loved tiki style, I'd steered clear of tiki drinks for one very stupid reason--I hate coconut. I had always assumed (what a noob) that tiki drinks are all filled with coconut (I mean...in my defense...they ARE often served in coconut shells!). So it was with trepidation that I read over the menu and finally said "OK, I guess...I'll just have the zombie."
My first zombie. What a moment. It's not often in one's 40s that one discovers something new and exciting, but here it was . It was always there and I was TOO BLIND TO SEE! I. Loved. That. Zombie. My God...the FLAVOR! And NO coconut at all! Just layer after layer of rum and spice and citrus and more rum and even more rum...it was one of the best cocktails I had ever had. After two full days of drinking in New Orlean's finest bars, and here was a revelation. I tried Husband's Dr. Funk, and holy shit...I loved that, too!
And so it was that my current tiki obsession was born...in a nearly empty tiki bar above a Mexican restaurant. To be honest, if the bartender had been a bit more sociable, he could have probably reeled me into sitting there for the rest of the night throwing all my money at him, I was so happy. But as other reviewers have mentioned, there's not a lot of warmth coming from behind the bar at this establishment, which is why I dropped them half a point. Still, how can I give such a mind-opening experience less than five stars?! Thank you, Tiki Tolteca, for introducing me to one of my new favorite things.The Tiki gods have answered my prayers! New Orleans now has a fabulous Tiki bar, with just the right dark Polynesian atmosphere that's straight outta Trader Vics circa 1965. My mom would always regale me with stories about her times at Hawaii Kai in Manhattan in the 60s. As a child, I'd cherish our annual trips to Mai Kai in Fort Lauderdale (which still exists, apparently!) Fun fact: About 5 years ago, I was a featured bartender in Inked Magazine where I talk about making Tiki drinks (you can see the photo in my profile), as I worked in a Tiki bar in NYC (Waikiki Wally's RIP).
So, yeah. I'm a lover all things Tiki, though I have to admit, I hate loathe and despise sweet drinks for obvious reasons, but hell, it's a Yelp review so I'll just come out and say it: usually sweet drinks mask cheap liquor. Usually sweet drinks are meant for people who aren't drinkers and can't stand the taste of alcohol. And last but certainly not least, sweet drinks mean for inevitable hangover. I pride myself on being a veteran drinker and at most, get one hangover a year. In fact, my year anniversary of my last hangover is coming up. July 4. 
The fabulous thing is, Tiki Tolteca offers up *craft* Tiki drinks. Yes, you're reading that correctly. Look at my menu photos that detail the ingredients! They even offer up little stories with each drink. Their cocktails don't only feature rum, but such lovely spirits as my beloved Mezcal, and my much less beloved caçaca. I settled on a Hemingway Daiquiri, which is frozen and perfect because it's not a fruit daiquiri, so not filled with artificial nonsense, just lime, rum, & maraschino liqueur. And potent, seeing as I was feeling a nice buzz after two.
They also have a menu feature small plates with a tropical flavor. DO NOT PASS UP THAT CHOCOLATE TRUFFLE DESSERT. The Tiki gods command it, too. Seriously. It really is the stuff of the gods. Chocolate, coconut, banana sauce... 'scuse me while I talk in tongues. I look forward to going back and trying the sweet corn tamales (vegetarian!). No crab rangoons, though, thankfully (created at Don the Beachcomber and now for some reason is expected on any given Chinese restaurant menu for some perplexing reason).
Oh!! Be sure and order a High Life, if you're so inclined, so you can get the full bottle service experience. This is no joke. They serve it in Champagne glasses and ice your bottle. Luckily my drinking partners indulged so I didn't have to.
More fun trivia. You may see in my profile that my current (and forever) crush is Howard Hughes. Apparently there's a tale of him drinking one too many zombies at Don the Beachcomber and then killed a pedestrian with his car. Bad Howie!! I hope it's not true. But yeah, beware the ENTIRE ZOMBIE MENU (seriously. TIki Tolteca has an entire zombie menu!!)
What's next Tiki Tolteca? Maybe scheduled thunderstorms over a lagoon a la San Francisco's Tonga Room?This is a great dive bar.   
Best Mai Tai since Hilton Hawaiian Village in Waikiki!!!
Found his place on 1st day in New Orleans.
Will be coming back during the rest of my trip!Awesome place for tiki cocktails!!!  They did a great job on the interior, and the drinks are totally off a classic tiki menu.Any tiki bar that offers several kinds of Mai Tai's and Zombie's is alright in my book.  I also enjoyed the "punny" drink names.  The drinks themselves were legit and well balanced tiki drinks.
The only thing I didn't care for was the atmosphere.  It was quieter compared to some other bars, which I actually liked since you can carry on a conversation.  But the decorations themselves are a bit sparse, so you don't quite get that dark, tiki vibe.  However, shortly after I visited Tiki Tolteca, they closed for renovations, so hopefully, they renovate with a better tiki vibe.Best damn Tiki Bar in NO. The drinks are all hand made by expert mixologist.  Don't settle for street auto-blender drinks.  Come get a real drink!Terrible drinks (taste like herbal medicine) stinky service, well non-existent service. No greeters, no hellos... Nothing. I'll be back to Latitude 29!Found out about this spot from Twitter and on my latest trip to NOLA had to check it out. They are typically only open a few days a week but since it was TOTC, they were open all weekend. Hooray for that!
By the time we got here, we had been drinking all day so we were in for a drink and some snacks and were out. But we loved it! The tiki atmosphere is totally there and the service was great. We all had the mai tai because that's the best way to gauge whether or not a tiki bar has it right. Lo and behold - it was spot on and we happily drank our mai tais and had a snack of ceviche before heading out for the rest of our night.
Definitely putting Tiki Tolteca on my regular list of spots to hit in NOLA.I really liked this place but I can't say too much.  The drinks were good, but pricey.  It was really cold in there.  Cool vibe, good drinks, but nothing to write home about.
I would definitely check it out, especially if you are in a group.  I think it was just an off night when we went because it was kind of dead and bleh in there.Daniel is an artist in garnish AND conversation. Cheers! (And I got a bit of an education in spirits in addition.)This year I have been reunited with my love of all things tiki. I wanted a big tiki bar birthday blowout with classic (read: not sickening sweet) drinks, 60's music, and an atmosphere where all my friends could hang out and have a blast. Well I didn't get my birthday party, but I did get Tiki Tolteca this summer and it almost makes up for everything else. I love this place so much. It is without a doubt my summer crush. It is only open Tuesdays and Thursdays for now, but these have been some of my best Thursdays. Its location still a bit of a secret, I feel like I stepped into a secret clubhouse at the top of Felipe's. The bartenders and staff are friendly and pretty attentive. I am partial to the lady DJ who tends to spin less Bob Marley and more 60's beach tunes, but as long as they are serving craft tiki cocktails my friends and I are happy in this dim lit oasis. With a full menu of Mai Tai and Zombie variations, two pages of other tiki classic twists, as well as a page of small plates, this is the best place to get away from everything else in your busy icky life. I also highly recommend staying for "Mai Time". At 11pm for their last open hour, they have a menu of Mai Tais for $5 apiece.  Go on Tuesdays! (Thursdays are my night)Loved the atmosphere but I couldn't get a drink! Bartender was too busy washing glasses! Went to another bar...Tiki Tolteca was my final bar destination for my trip to New Orleans. With Lat 29 right around the corner, and reading Tiki Tolteca was over a Taco Stand, it wasn't too high on my list of bars to visit. I had a little time left and room for one  more drink, so what the hell. I ended up hanging out at the bar for a couple hours. It was a relatively slow night, but everyone who came through sat around the bar and talked to each other. I met folks from Birmingham, San Francisco and locals as well. The bartenders kept the energy up for it being a slow night and were happy to talk tiki and make recommendations for other fun drinking spots next time I'm in town. They might not be the highest quality tiki drinks, but in my opinion the customer service / communal aspect of the bar was top notch. And... the drinks we're certainly good enough. They had a nice assortment of non-traditional tiki drinks on the menu and they knew what they were talking about Tiki-wise. It was the perfect send off from NOLA. Also... the tacos downstairs were just what I needed for the walk back to the hotel.Phenomenal experience! The bartenders were warm, accommodating, and professional. The drinks are delicious and ordering from the taqueria downstairs is a godsend. 
Tiki Tolteca is one of the best bar experiences I've ever had. If you enjoy drinking and enjoying a relaxed atmosphere, please visit.This is a hidden gem! And soon to be a bigger and noticeable according to the bartenders. The atmosphere is great! I love the tiki bar look and it's different from what you get on Bourbon. But the star of this place are the drinks! I had the Mai tai and it was perfect.. My husband had a tequila drink and that was yummy too. This place is a definite stop!There are pros and cons to this place. It can accommodate a larger group and its a more traditional bar. They have great happy hour specials! $5 mai tais can't be beat! It's a super cute bar with a nice clean bathroom and lots of seats. My only complaint is when we came by at around 6pm, there was only one bartender and he was really rude. He ignored several of our people and when a pregnant woman asked if he could make her something non-alcoholic, he said no. How can you refuse to make a pregnant lady a non-alcoholic beverage?! So we loved almost everything about our experience here except the bartender.As far as tiki bars goes, this New Orleans French Quarter spot kinda blows.
I've been to most of the tiki bars in the country and this, for me, has been the most disappointing.  I feel like anybody who 'five-stars' this place hasn't been to a good tiki bar anywhere else.  It feels like the owners wanted to own a tiki bar because they were trendy but they don't really know much about what makes a tiki bar great.  Namely, the drinks.   
The ambiance is pretty weak, the drinks aren't very tasty, and those gummy tiki head things are atrocious.  
A much, much, MUCH better option would be to head back downstairs, turn left on Decatur and walk about a hundred feet to Beachbum Berry's Latitude 29.  Those bartenders really know how to make a tiki drink.Absolutely horrible service. Will never go back. Sat down and they gave us a menu. Then never came back to get order. Do not go here! Service lacks to an extreme. Absolutely no southern hospitality. Whoever owns need to reevaluate their employees!Whether you are visiting New Orleans or are a local this is a must do. You have to walk through a taco restaurant  and go upstairs to get to this tiki paradise, but once you're there you feel like you have been transformed to an island paradise. From the music to the decor to the bartenders to of course the cocktails this place is top notch. We spent hours here trying so many different cocktails and have no regrets. They have a good variety of cocktails for various palettes (I like sweet, while my fiancé likes strong) and they are willing to make you something off the menu to suite your tastes as well. The blue Hawaiian, painkiller, and mai tais were all delicious! They also have alcohol infused gummies which are worth a try. While the cocktails aren't cheap if you stay for four hours like we did they are quality and every cocktail looks like it belongs on an Instagram feed. They also have different specials everyday. We sat at the bar, but they have tons of lounge areas as well. Be sure to check them out, even if it's for just one drink...you won't regret it! :)We came upon this place while in New Orleans one day.. Obviously not what one thinks about as a New Orleans meal.. Lol.. The food is good, the place is clean and open, there is a separate bar area and you can even sit near the windows with a partial view out toward the Mississippi River ... Order nachos and have them add your favorites... It's pretty darn good! LolTiki Tolteca is probably one of my top 3 favorite bars ever. My first experience there was Sunday night, and I loved it! The bartender Danny was super nice, took time to listen and deliver great cocktails. He never once looked frustrated, and encouraged us to do fun things like spin the wheel, buy an extra edible flower, etc. He even made my drinks extra bitter for me! (I have a weird love of bitter drinks). I can't wait to come back to NOLA and drink here again! What a fun bar.It is seldom that I am underwhelmed by a tiki bar. But I have to say, overall, I was not that impressed with this one. My bf and I stopped in one night and ordered a drink to share, as we were already getting a little soused. The bartender looked disinterested and bored, and did not crack a smile or engage us in any way. He had the personality of a piece of cardboard, which is not typical of a tiki bar at all. I have yet to go to one and find such a surly welcoming committee. 
The bar itself is actually very lovely, and HUGE. I think it has a bit too much space, given how empty it was when we walked in. But who knows? Maybe it gets busier over the weekend. I am not really sure. It is, however, well-decorated, and about as tiki-fied as you can get. Bonus points for the decor and seating. They also have an interesting spin-the-wheel game, for those who can't decide what to drink. 
The next night, I visited once again, and the bartender that night was much more engaging and friendly, cracking jokes and bantering with the patrons sitting at the bar. The only downside? They were out of the liquor gummies I wanted to try, and they were also out of their house-aged rum they use to make their strong Mai Tais. Oh, well. The drinks he made for us were good, though. Made up for the experience the night before, anyway!After reading all my friends' 5 star reviews, I was expecting to be wowed, but the drinks I tasted (during Tales so maybe they were overworked?) were all way too sour. We had the classic Mai Tai, a Hurricane and ...something smokey tasting. The hurricane was actually the best of the drinks. The mai tai was so sour that it tasted more like a margarita, definitely not what I was expecting. 
As for the atmosphere, it's very warehouse-y with a bunch of decorations slapped around. And while there was table service, they were a bit overwhelmed while I was there. The prices are good for the size of the drinks.
Maybe I just need to go back when it's not Tales.Myself, my wife, and another couple visited on a slow Saturday afternoon, 8/19/17. The bartender Zacaria, was without a doubt the worst bartender I have ever encountered, and believe me I have encountered a few. From reading some of the other reviews it sounds like several people have been unlucky enough to have been " served" by him. 
When one of us asked for a drink not on the menu, he just said rudely " We don't make that." When my wife asked " So what would I like to drink do you think?" he answered, "I don't know what you like."
He was one of the rudest, most unprofessional bartenders any of us could remember ever encountering.
To top thinks off,  when we went downstairs to talk to the manager, we were told the manager was too busy to talk to us.
Typical place that knows they will get tourist traffic and doesn't need repeat customers.This bar was recommend by a local. If you like the tiki bar feel this place reminds me of Trader's Vic from the vibe of the place and the drinks. The staff was nice, however the only option you really have is drinks. 
If you want food, they have a menu for the Mexican restaurant downstairs. You have the ability to order food and pick it up from the bar. There was no music or entertainment, just drinks. 
If you're looking for an intimate place to go, this is your place. However, I was looking for more of a fun vibe with music and food options. I may have been looking for that Trader's Vic vibe with food, music, and drinks. Definitely not a bad place if you're looking for the intimate Tiki environment. It might get rowdy later, I was day drinking...Delicious drinks, cool tiki atmosphere. The Hurricane is like no other we tasted in New Orleans.3.5 stars -- rounded up to 4 for uniqueness!
This tiki bar is a little hidden gem. It's located upstairs from the Mexican restaurant (Felipes) on the corner. I love the interior decor - they have anything from couches to wooden benches! Plenty of comfortable seating of your choice. The lighting is dark and they have really cool tiki-style lamps hanging from the ceiling. I love that it wasn't very crowded nor loud, so we could talk amongst ourselves without straining our voices. It's also very clean for a bar.
My friends and I ordered a flaming punch bowl concoction and it was amazing-ly strong. Not the best tasting but hey when it gets the job done, I ain't complaining if they ain't being cheap with the alcohol % content! 
Stop by here during your French Quarter adventures!I have been going to the Felipes below this bar for years and only recently ventured upstairs. I have to say it is the perfect place to hang out with friends in the french quarter. 
The interior is amazing, the vibe is just right, it is dark and they pretty much have the tiki thing down to a science. What is great about this place is that it is generally not super crowded so you can talk to your friends and they can actually hear you. The entire establishment is very clean including the bathrooms. 
They have friendly staff and the list of available drinks is extensive. They even have gummies with booze in them! 
My friends and I ordered a flaming punch bowl concoction and it was amazing. This place is a gem and I cannot wait to go back!This has become our go to Tiki Bar in NOLA.   It's above Felipe's and its easy to miss the stairwell entrance on the side of the building. If you are into classic tiki, which we are, you will be rewarded at the top of the stairs.  The décor is traditional tiki.  Lots of tiki statues, fake flowers, tropical prints and bamboo.  There is a thatch covered tiki bar where drinks are served and plenty of couches and chairs to go around.  The menu of tiki drinks is one of the largest we've found in NOLA.  A mix of traditional and creative spins on drinks all served in tiki glasses.  There should be something for suit everyone's taste.  Two of the more unusal and fun items on the menu are the Zombie shots and jello shots.  The jello shots are shaped like tiki totems and are served as three per serving.  They pack a bit of a punch and are fun to eat.  The Zombie shots are my favorite.  The shot is served in a refillable tiki shot glass with a story to take the glass home and feed it plenty of rum.  
On the occasions we have been there, there has been music playing in the background, but it is not a focal point.  The place is dark (as most tiki bars we've been to are) and is a good place to relax and enjoy a good tropical drink.  If you are looking for more of a club atmosphere, this is not the place for you to spend your night.  If you get hungry, you can order some food from Felipe's at the bar and they will bring it up stairs for you.After wondering around the French quarter with all the loud crowded bars I was thrilled to find this place. It is on the second floor and as soon as you enter you no longer feel like you are in New Orleans. It is a very laid back crowd. Both of the drinks we ordered we very much on point with other tiki bars we have visited. We also got the alcoholic tiki heads. At $9 they are really more of a novelty, good to order once just for the quirkiness of them. If I'm ever back in town I'm definitely coming back.This place is awesome. If you are visiting NOLA it is a must visit. It's a bit tricky to find but sometimes a piece of paradise should be.Such a cool place! I felt like I was in someone's 1970's basement. It's not super touristy, just has a real cool tiki bar vibe. The drinks are all sweet, so not something I could do all of the time, but definitely a fun place to go for a special occasion. The bartenders were fantastic!
I still think about this bar and cannot wait to go back. Definitely a hidden gem in NOLA. It actually is somewhat hidden, as it's above a burrito restaurant and not the easiest to find.Spacious, secret second-floor gem of a bar festooned with tropical, ship-wrecked Tiki decor.  These drinks are labor-intensive but we felt they came out as quickly as can be reasonably expected and were always well executed. Quirky, pleasant music played at a nice volume below the lively bar conversation, the bartenders both chatty & friendly as they worked. The best sign of a great barkeep is when they care enough to ask "what do you usually drink, what spirits do you favor?"  This lead to off-menu delights such as the lively Singapore Sling & a bright Fogcutter (I favor GIN Tiki). We spent the better part of a dark & rainy night being charmed by the staff.  Happily we sat sipping the stiff, excellent drinks and later devoured some great nachos from downstairs (which they ordered & had brought up for us).  Cheers to hopefully many happy returns.I never knew this place existed until 2 weeks ago.   Really nice bar to duck off in and escape the noise of downtown.  The ambiance is what you would expect from a stereotypical tiki bar.  The drinks have some interesting flavors, seemed like a lot of spice or bitters was used.
The best thing about this place is that it's dark inside and not too crowded.  My wife and I had no problem finding space at the bar on a Friday evening.  One of the drinks came with a post card, and my friend confirmed that he received it 5 days later...  It was definitely worth the trip.I was pretty excited to go to Tiki Tolteca, but I left somewhat disappointed. I was there on a Monday night and my mom and I were the only ones in the bar. I get it. Monday isn't the biggest night to go out, but dang, this is New Orleans, right? It was about 9 o'clock when we arrived and there were 3 guys behind the bar. I had checked the website prior to going, to see what they had in the way of non-alcoholic drinks. They didn't seem to have any, so I asked one of the bartenders if he could make anything. His response was a fairly unenthused, "I guess I could try". This didn't make me want to stay very much, but we were there and my mom settled on a Mai Tai. I asked, more specifically this time for something maybe, pineapple and coconutty. I got that and I have to give it to him, that was very delicious. 
The atmosphere is great. Lots of groovy little couches and tiki decor. The space is probably super when there are more than 2 customers, but since it was just us, we finished our drinks, and were on our way. I would try this place again, if I find myself in New Orleans. If you're a tiki bar fan, definitely check it out. Maybe just go later in the week.I look for tiki bars in every city I visit. This one did not disappoint! They have many great drink options and they are served in cute tiki mugs. I had the "what a aspirin is" and it was so good. My friend had a "fog cutter" which is not on the menu buy the bartender was happy to make it. The place was empty on a Sunday night at 9pm , kind of odd . I hope it gets busier because this place is awesome! There is plenty of seating and a very cozy vibe with couches and stools everywhere.Only thing that kind of sucked is that they were out of the tiki shot glasses, we were hoping to purchase the shot to keep the tiki glass.PS. you can order food from Felipe's and it is delicious!There's a beautiful redhead bartender who makes the sexiest dark and stormy I've ever had the pleasure of drinking. And their shot glasses are the most adorable things on the planet. AND YOU GET TO KEEP THEM!!Another fantastic recommendation from some friends that visit NOLA often. This was unfortunately last on our list as the wifey and I were a bit sketchy on a tiki bar located in the French Quarter... but hey! This works... it was a great break from the French Quarter even if it was only for a few stiff drinks. Wifey played it safe with the Mai Tai and I went with the Zombie. Damn, both were creepers and definitely made are walk back to the hotel an adventure. Surf music, tiki decor, laid back staff... what else could you ask for? A perfect spot for a drink!Great authentic tiki bar drinks. My friend who bartends brought me here and her compatriots are all fans as well. Yeah it's not the cheap swill you get in other french quarter places but you're paying for quality. And you can take the mexican food from downstairs inside for the double whammy.Literally right around the corner from the only other tiki bar in the quarter.  Neat place with good atmosphere and decor and nice cool air conditioning (essential in August).  Decent selection of tiki drinks available along with Red Stripe beer in a bottle.  We had a poor experience with one of the staff members but the owner advises that it has been addressed.   Recommended and check out the one around the corner too!After a recent visit that was less satisfactory upon hearing my concerns ownership of the establishment reached out to me to hear my concerns as well as to offer apologizes. Knowing how many customers walk through the doors of any bar in the French Quarter and knowing Tiki Tolteca took my comments to heart was extemely refreshing. It also shows the owners and team greatly care about their customer experience.wish i lived in new orleans so i could come here all the time. great drinks & ambiance, plus the DJ there on a thursday night was throwing down some awesome tiki appropriate sounds. only wish the fancy $14 zombie drink came in one of those cool tiki cups! 
ps. thanks to the bartender because the 1st night we went, we arrived just after last call. he was cool enough to make 4 of us some EXCELLENT drinks to go. that was above and beyond. thanks so much!So cool!  The renovation has provided a Great Tiki bar in a fun atmosphere. Bartenders are mixing authentic cocktails in really neat glassware.When I came in at 11:00 PM the two other customers were bartenders at high end New Orleans bars, a testament to the high quality of the drinks here. I found out that the space is converted to rentable party space every weekend, which is why tiki days are only Tuesday through Thursday. Trader Dick makes all his own syrups, including the difficult orgeat, and I had a great time talking to him. The drinks were honest, not sugar sweet, and tasty. Since I was visiting New Orleans I had a Hurricane, which was the real deal, as was the Aku Aku Zombie. 
Off the beaten track and highly recommended.We walked into this bar last night - December 12th,  after we were refused service at another bar because of our group size.
The bartender, who's name I didn't get, didn't blink an eye.  He made cocktails - and put on show - right down to the mocktail we ordered. 
We were out looking for an amazing cocktail experience and he delivered.We visited THE DAY (Aug 28, '16) this place was mentioned in the New York Times magazine... still an off night. The place was empty and the service was almost offensive. Disappointing. The drinks menu looks so fun, I hope others enjoy.My boyfriend and I stumbled onto this place accidentally and decided to give it a shot. So glad we did! We're always looking for cocktails and drinks we've never tried before, and this totally hit the spot. The bartender told us it's been recently rated the best new bar in America by Food & Beverage magazine. It's definitely unique. We tried the Baska Face, which is described as "smoky, bitter, and wow!" Definitely agree. I believe it has cinnamon in it. Worth a try if you're into unique drinks! We'll probably be back before we head out tomorrow.Hidden spot...small when you get up there, but has a cool atmosphere. The drinks are cool and come in different glasses. I would suggest the one two punch.Food was ok, although was painfully slow process to be served, staff generally unhappy about being there, all in all not a place I'd love to visit againBest hurricane in town! (I'm making a definitive list. Give me some time) the bartenders are all quick with jokes, excellent service and great cocktails. The tiki drinks are crafted with extreme care and efficiency and if you're very very nice, they'll mix you a damn fine sazerac.It's a unique bar with pretty good drinks. If you want to hangout in relatively calmer and cool place with a couple of friends, this is worth a try. Downstairs, there is a taco place where you can get some nice tacos.super cute bar. no service. those gummy bear things are soo powerful. be warned. kinda made my stomach hurt. 3 for $10. there was a few people in here with their tropical drinksHad no idea! Thankfully some locals took us in and I'll be back! In through a Mexican restaurant and up the stairs to the best Mai Tai ever. I though I had real ones in Hawaii but I was mistaken. You can order food from Felipe's when you are upstairs at this bar. Worth checking out. Bartender was very friendly!My friend recommended this place to me when he heard I was traveling to New Orleans. I'm from Pensacola FL where the cocktail scene is still pretty new. I was told that my fiancé and I must order the frozen Hemingway Daiquiri. Let me tell you it was AMAZING! Our bartenders Renee and Nathan took very good care of us. I must say that if you are wanting to try something pretty out of this world then order the "Miracle Berry Trip". I've never had anything like that in my life! I highly recommend this place to anyone that enjoys fantastic service, drinks,  and atmosphere! Nothing short of excellence at this place!This is a very worth finding spot when in New Orleans.  Creative cocktails, quirky staff, friendly vibe.  Dark cozy decor to match.For the love that all things Tiki I was hoping to be wowed by this bar. They have all the ingredients for a top star establishment but fall short on customer service and timeliness on getting clients a drink.
Venue is up a flight of stairs and provides an air conditioned oasis w/tiki decor that puts one in an immediate mood of relaxation that soon turns to frustration when the only bar tender takes forever and a day to "craft" his drinks then hits you with a snarky attitude when asking questions about their menu.
I have been to plenty of craft cocktail establishments to know each one takes time. I was willing to overlook the timeliness issue if the bartender's attitude wasn't so indifferent when asking about their gummies. Answer = "they are gummies"....OKAY. In effort to get menu items sold one would think examples could be shown of what I finally learned are cocktail infused treats.
Wish I could rate higher as my first and only drink = fog cutter.Great drinks and atmosphere 
I miss the drink with the flower that sizzled on your tongue 
I find that if you aren't at the bar you won't get service 
A few years back they had an awesome bartender a tall dude maybe from Hawaii.  Miss him
You can order food from downstairs which is a big plusThe bartenders were awesome and very accommodating. Had an absolute blast. Elena made  the best pain killer I've ever had.Best drinks. Best service. Ask for zack. Short for Zachary. Best bartender we met on our visit to nola. Much love from the Midwest.A really cool place, if you like tikl bars - and I do like tiki bars...!!!
Fun, totally unexpected tiki interior for New Orleans. In a dark, second floor space above a Mexican burrito bar.
Strong drinks, with a GREAT happy hour. Definitely the best five dollar hurricanes and mai tais I've ever had. Friendly service. Not too crowded. 
Absolutely loved it. We will definitely return...
