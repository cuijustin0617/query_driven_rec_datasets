Came to French toast on our trip to New Orleans for breakfast! It was the best breakfast I had on our whole trip. I got the salmon toast with an over hard egg. The fried chicken and waffles looked delicious but too heavy for us because we were flying out that morning. The bread is fluffy and fresh. I also got a latte which was amazing!! I'm pretty sure everything on the menu is delicious and you can't go wrong. Staff was friendly as well! This would definitely be a place I would go back to when I visit Again in the futureA very accessible place for breakfast on Decatur St in the French Quarter.  Great selection and reasonable prices. Clean and bright with very good service. I had the crepes with mushroom, onion, spinach and goat cheese which was ample and perfectly done. My partner had the avocado toast with sunny egg which she loved.Fantastic breakfast spot. Always packed. The Marci Gras French toast, stuffed with cinnamon cream cheese was pretty great. Enough for two.Made reservations through OpenTable. Arrived and it was busy weekend so we were seated at bar (party of two). Mimosas for drinks and cool part is we could see through the receiving window and watch our food cooked. Energy was upbeat and food was deliciousGreat place to stop in when in town. Servers were great, food great and the hot sauce amazing!  Definitely call ahead, hostess was great to work with about the wait and everything.This was a great place for breakfast/brunch. The lemon curd crepes were fantastic, as was the chicken and waffles. Overall this was a great atmosphere in a great location... that wait staff was also very friendly... I would definitely eat there again soon!The only reason I don't give 5 stars is because the first time we went, we got on the waitlist online and it said to be there at a certain time. We walked from our house which is 15min walk time away, and made it on time, only to have the hostess tell us (with an attitude) that we have to wait in line and be put on the waitlist all over again (Which was over 1hr wait) 
After a few weeks went by, we arrived at 8am opening time and the food was great. I definitely recommend the puffed pancakes with lemon curd.WHY WE WENT HERE:

THE TASTE:

CUSTOMER SERVICE:
- super warm and welcomingThe service was slow. It appears the shop just opened and still getting organized.  They forgot to put our order in! Once we got our food, all was forgiven. The French toast was delicious!  Their were so many new things to try. Delish!!!Delicious try the pom mimossa it's the best !!! Waffles are good too and that Mardi grad toast tooOne of the best breakfast experiences my girlfriend and I have ever had and we love breakfast! The king cake French toast made us cry tears of joy. 
The salmon toast was a nice savory complement to the sweet French toast.Affordable brunch in the Quarter. 
-coconut cream French toast = yummy 
- ratatouille omelette = yummy 
- toast + house jam = yummy 
- abelskivers = yummy 
Don't trust the yelp provided wait time / join the waitlist feature. We joined when it said 15/35 mins.... took over an hour for us to be seated.Best morning pick me up EVER. With multiple flavors of mimosas (that hibiscus tho) and all of the lovely breakfast works of art to choose from, French Toast has you taken care of. 
Our server was a charm and helped us narrow down our choices. She did a great job! 
Now I could give you the spiel on the food and environment and what not, but photos are worth a thousand words. This food is equally as beautiful as it is delicious. 10/10.Service was not desiarable. Had to ask for service. Order a hanger steak mid rare. Came out raw all red no pink. Asked for cook up to medium came back sliced and medium well. Asked for just a refill on drink for compensation and was told I had to pay for refill. Will not return.Ebelskiver appetizer with lemon curd are divine. Definitely go for the larger size because your table will be fighting for the last one. My classic breakfast had perfectly poached eggs and I am particular about those. My dining partners really enjoyed their entrees which all looked equally  as appetizing. Was thrilled to find a yummy brunch place and it DOES serve alcohol which is not apparent in the online menu. Definitely can't wait to return and you can join the waitlist on yelp.This little place is really cute. It's in the New Orleans French Quarter, just past the open air market, and well worth a visit! It's a small place with a front wall of windows, booths and a long counter. It's bright and airy, extremely clean and welcoming. We went in for a late brunch, and were welcomed by just about all the front of the house staff. Our Server Whitney helped us quickly, and was extremely knowledgeable about the menu. We decided to try a few different things since this was our first visit. We ordered the Ham, Mushroom, and Gruyere Crepe, with fresh (I mean super fresh!) fruit, the Lemon Curd and Cream Crepe (The whipped cream was homemade!), the Abelskivers (Little Puffed pancakes with a side of lemon curd),  also sides of Grits, and Bacon. Let me tell you, it was all DELICIOUS!! Everything was fresh, hot, and cooked to perfection! Nothing was overly seasoned, or too heavy. It was a good, refreshing meal. I have gluten issues and left this place feeling just fine after eating! That doesn't happen often. Good ingredients, and great taste. A win-win! We will return to try more of the menu items. I've been told that the friend oysters are also great, so I'll save that for my next review. Until then, Happy Eating!!This was our first visit to French Toast, and it won't be our last!! It's a small little place so be prepared to wait (that's why I am giving them 4 stars: we had an hour wait... However, the French Market is right down the street and helped occupy our time) for a table or even a spot at the bar.  The waitstaff was so nice and attentive. We decided to share the Kings Cake french toast and a side order of bacon... Everything was delicious!!Great service was awesome can't wait to go back they had a king cake French toast that looks so deliciousPretty good.  I'd say 3.5 stars for my first visit.  It wasn't too busy on a Friday morning.  I easily got a seat at the bar.  Service was a bit slow, and coffee needed to be brewed.  The atmosphere is bright and spacious for a smaller joint.  I ordered a vegetable crepe with potatoes.  The crepe was good, the potatoes unremarkable.  I'd come back, especially due to the ease by which to squeeze in there on a bustling, sunny day.Best French toast ever! Definitely recommend. The chicken and waffles were pretty amazing too.Holy moly, thanks to Sarah L. for finding this gem last-minute (our first and last morning in New Orleans before leaving on a cruise). French Toast definitely served some tasty dishes and I wished they were able to deliver about 2,250 miles away. Too bad I'm outside their delivery window (just by a little heh). 
We came on a Monday morning, and luckily were seated right away! It's a small space diner-style, with a large display counter. The sunlight shines through naturally brightening the room up! 
We ordered the following: 
King's cake french toast
Chicken n waffles 
Side bacon
Our food was so darn good. King's cake french toast was thicc, and stuffed with a cinnamon sugar cream cheese. No need for syrup, this thing was perfectly sweet on its own! The chicken and waffles came with a cayenne butter that I wanted to slather on anything and everything. The bacon was crisp and salty. 
Even days after we dined at French Toast, I couldn't stop thinking about our meal and wanted to come again. Too bad it'll have to be the next time I'm in New Orleans! Til then!So, so good! Service awesome and food was delicious.  We had banana & Nutella crepes (YUM) and a basic scrambled egg breakfast -but the eggs were awesome, bacon perfect, crazy good biscuit (ask for the cayenne bottle to go with it!) and the best grits I've ever had.  Great drinks too!  Loved it!!The food is really good I had the chicken and waffles and it comes with this delicious butter that is infused with something idek but was yummy! The greats were also very yummy! My wife had the French toast and she loved it. Our waiter Justine amazing!!! He was very tentative and made sure we had what needed! Defiantly a good place to eat!I am vegan so finding something in New Orleans has been hard.  These guys made me a special order.  They even have soy milk! So happy!!Great breakfast spot.  Everything we had was tasty.  Eggs, great bacon and of course yummy French toast.  Highly recommend.Very good brunch spot. My friends and I tried different things but our favorite hands-down was the chicken and waffles. Good service as wellNow for my first time in New Orleans, this place really took me by surprise I ended up he on a whine but it was the best thing I could have stumbled upon I have to say their Chicken and waffles was bomb recommend it if you're in the city.Cute spot with good food options for breakfast/brunch. Nothing fancy, but it doesn't need to be. They serve quality food that's simple. Walking distance from Jackson square.Excellent breakfast in Nola. Had the kings cake French toast. Omg! So evil and delicious! The maple syrup was crazy good too and the bacon was perfect! It's a smaller place so be prepared to wait. We ended up sitting at the counter. Still was nice. Didn't realize it was connected to the hotel there until our family members staying there above the restaurant came right down and it was just a funny coincidence. I love unique breakfast places with unique offerings so I would definitely recommend this place!I would give this place two stars, but the service was pretty good, so - 3. 
My stuffed french toast was - well, stuffed. It had good flavor overall, but because of the cinnamon cream cheese stuffing it was a bit doughy. My wife opted for the catfish with grits; her grits were on the bland side, and the catfish was just ok.Great breakfast, half the cost of Brennan's, clean and nothing was dripping with oil or cold. The ratatouille stood out as did the thick toast, but most people may not have a pallet for eggs and veggies. The food was excellent, but I expect that and no one gets extra points  for serving good food. Service was friendly, helpful and attentive.  The menu selections were enough to make me come back to try other items.Awesome, visiting from Florida. I love eating all over New Orleans, rarely disappointed. This place was great, between the two of us, the crepe, omelette, grits, potatoes, all highlights, even the coffee was great! Service was great, (thanks Mike) worth the wait time, (check in ahead.)Service was good. Food wasn't off the charts, but good. The French toast is very large. We ended up splitting an order between all of us. Very thick & dense, but good.The food was a huge let down. The waffles were hard as a rock. We will not be coming back because the food was such a disappointment.I have to start of by saying I'm not the pancakes and eggs type of girl. I would rather have oatmeal or yogurt for breakfast. However, I stopped in breakfast while my stay in NOLA. Our server was so accommodating, patient, and knowledgeable. He made ordering that much easier. I  started off with the puff pancakes with lemon curd and Nutella must get!! I opted for the breakfast biscuit - fresh, delicious, savory and the eggs really complimented it. I would def come back if I'm ever in NOLA.This place was worth the wait ! The French toast tasted like cake and the chicken and waffles were spectacular! My family and I will be back !This place is in high demand so Deff reserve online in advance. Great food and service, six of us and everyone enjoyed their food. My Chicken and waffles were amazing! Had a bite of the coconut French toast from a friend and that was great as well. On top of the refills and personable staff.We discovered this restaurant because it had a back entrance from our hotel, the Provencial. Best place to stumble upon!
So, so good! Had the fried chicken and waffles, which was absolutely delicious. The butter for the waffles (cayenne butter?) could've been eaten just by itself quite honestly, but the waffles were delicious and the chicken was just so... delicious *chef's kiss*
My mother had the coconut cream stuffed french toast, and damn do they know how to do french toast. Should've guessed from the name. 
Overall a great experience, even if you have to wait a little bit. My mother and I stuck our names on the waiting list and came back when they texted us, which made it nice they have a bit of a small location and its across from the French Market. 
tdlr; Delicious, amazing, show stopping, all the superlatives! The fried chicken and waffles in particular are amazing, but really anything on the menu is worth trying!The restaurant was full, so we opted to sit at the bar rather than wait.  Our server was friendly and our service was fast.  I at the avocado toast while my husband had the classic breakfast.  They were both good, but the French toast was the star of the show.  We had the coconut cream stuffed French toast.  It was filled with creamy coconut, topped with a grilled pineapple and sugared macadamia nuts.  It was huge and one serving was more than enough for us to share.  We would for sure go back!One of the beat breakfast spots we've eaten at in NOLA. My husband didn't talk for 15 minutes while he was eating the chicken & waffles. I had the salmon & cream cheese toast & added avocado. It was incredible!!!! We had the lemon crepes too but couldn't eat all of it. Food portions are large even for the price. Get the coffee!!!!!!! I'm still in food coma. Will be going back again soon. Thanks to Michelle there for the great service. 
I recommend sitting at the bar so you can watch all the good food as it comes up ready. Enjoy!I really didn't even eat, I don't know how the food was but I assure you that the host and the service was the worst of all.  if you come to New Orleans visit other places because the experience of this place was the worst of my trip.I had the chicken and waffles and it was very good. It came with a Cajun butter sauce that added just a touch of spice. It was a healthy portion. The.chicken was not seasoned like I would have like but who needs salt anyway. We also had the pancake balls with powdered sugar. They were good while hot. Atmosphere was casual and family friendly. It is right across from the French Market.Wonderful food but awful service. Servers were cleaning the floors and tables and then serving us food without changing gloves. More concerned about covid than their jobs. I would highly recommend finding another breakfast spot. The opposite of Louisiana hospitality we have found everywhere else. But again, great food.We enjoyed our breakfast quite a bit. Had the chicken and waffles. Both where freshly prepared and had good flavor. We graze our way through Mew Orleans and split the dish. Was plenty of food. Milk punch was ok but Ruby Slipper does that better. We will no doubt be back for another breakfast.If you're in the French Quarter this is THE place to stop for breakfast. We went earlier enough and only had to wait for 5 minutes or so after checking in using the Yelp waitlist feature. I got the Croque Madame which was absolutely delicious. I've never had so many people ask me "Ooo that looks good, what is that?!" upon receiving an order. My mom got the classic breakfast and everything was perfect. The bacon was sweet and smoky, the grits were creamy. Seriously, make coming to French Toast a priority. It will be for me from now on!Food COFFEE and staff were amazing. Next time I am on New Orleans I will be sure to pay them a visit.Pancake balls were amazing. Bacon was thick and crispy. King cake French toast was fun.This was an awesome find.   Half orders should be offered.  Wait staff was great. Cute atmosphere. We'll be back.Just ate here for breakfast and it was by far the best food we've had so far. I ordered the fried chicken and waffles we shared grits w goat cheese (amazing)  & the potatoes. We also ordered the Mardi Gras French toast and an omelet. We were amazed by all the food we got. The pomegranate mimosas also and those were great!!I love this place it is the best breakfast I have ever had. The service awesome and the food spectacular, if you go there get the coconut French toast, aebleskiver ( sauces : lemon curd and Nutella), and fried chicken and waffles. The waiter was nice and the bathrooms were clean.This food was RIDICULOUSLY good ! Literally everything ! Eggs was amazing ! Catfish omg!  Grits good af I'm so full ... WARNING don't get the French toast unless you haven't ate in three days ! They are HUGE but delicious ... can't lie the wait was like 1 hour plus but I swear I would wait two hours if I knew it was this goodWe visited as an last stop on our way back home for breakfast, I had the bacon egg and cheese on a biscuit it was good and my wife had the chicken and waffles which were perfectly cooked. The restaurant is small & a little cramped but nice. No complaintsOMG the Catfish Toast is life changing! Nothing but good here! Service felt like home with a smile and "look you in the eye" conversation. Food is right at every bite. A wonderful escape from the predictable NOLA tourist feel.Oh my!!! We did a sampling starting with the aebelskivers and lemon curd. Then two of us had the avacado toast with corn maque choux eggs and fried oysters, yes I said oysters for breakfast. We also had the crepe Florentine and then finished with the biscuit topped with chicken, pickles and spicy mayo. This was a flavorful breakfast experience and I would highly recommend everything we tasted.Cute little place in the French Quarter with delicious brunch. I wanted to order some of the french toast, but after 2 days in NOLA, my stomach couldn't handle such a heavy breakfast. I ordered the breakfast sandwich and my husband ordered the chicken and waffles and prosciutto toast. The breakfast sandwich was okay - the biscuit was just a little too dry for my taste, but the bacon was very good. My husband loved the chicken and waffles and found the chicken very well seasoned. The prosciutto toast was also very good with interesting flavor combinations. If I come back the next time we're in NOLA, I'm definitely going for the french toast!What a wonderful local experience, enhanced by server Tammy.  She was so welcoming and attentive.  The food choices are varied and prepared fresh.  We had the cheese and herb omelette and fresh fruit.  Everything was delicious and portions were large.  Great place right across from flea market.  They do respect the waitlist call ahead.Soooo very good! Make sure to call ahead to get your name on the list. Only complaint - staff could be a bit more friendly - like most establishments these days.It is a small place so there was a wait, even though I got on the list early through yelp.  Doesn't matter...Wait, it is worth it.  I had eggs and a crawfish hash that was absolutely delicious.  They were seriously the most perfectly cooked eggs I have ever had.  My wife got the guyere (sp) crepes with a salad.  The house dressing was so good, I didn't even get a taste.  When I asked how it was, it was already gone.  She loved the crepes with cheese and ham.  I want to note that we came over Memorial Day weekend and even though there was a wait, I did not feel at all rushed.  Server was friendly.I've been to all three locations of Toast, and I have to tell you, they are one of the top breakfast restaurants in New Orleans for a reason.  Food is always the best of the best.  One of my favorite dish is the catfish and grits.  I get it every time.  Highly recommend this place
For breakfast and brunch.Wow!  What a great find for a delicious breakfast right in the middle of the French Quarter!  I couldn't believe the atmosphere which was both cozy and welcoming.  We ordered an omelette which was plentiful, delicious and perfectly prepared.  I opted for a home made cheddar biscuit which was the best one I had ever had.  I chose the fruit salad as my side; the fruit was fresh and tasty.  Our server, Tammy was AMAZING, ATTENTIVE & PLEASANT!  This is a must for breakfast!Wow! Loved it (and I'm picky).  I had the ratatouille omlette-lots of whole tasted garlic cloves. I don't know what the brand of bacon was, but it was some of the best I've tasted. The house made salad dressing was great and the abbleskivers (sp?) lived up to their reputation. Heidi gave great service and Silky in the kitchen was constantly training while he worked.I've loved toast's original location for years. I enjoyed this visit and the addition of a bar.While visiting NO for Southern Decadence, I woke up early in the mood for a great breakfast and stumbled upon French Toast, which did not disappoint. I joined the waitlist through Yelp & arrived shortly around 9ish in a Saturday morning - I was seated immediately and the waitress was very courteous and attentive. The ambience, the food, the people - everything was great and easy. I even struck up convo with a couple and the table beside me who were visiting from Portland. 
The only thing I will note (& not necessarily bad things) but: 
1 - they don't offer bottomless, so the mimosas/Bloody Mary's are a la carte.
2 - the portions are fairly large, so be prepared to take a doggie bag.
Will definitely be back again!!I live 3 blocks away and have been there three times since they opened a couple weeks ago with varying numbers of co conspirators. Staff is great, food is delectable. I had one mediocre biscuit because it was a bit dry, but I'm betting my next biscuit there would be a win. The menu is decadent and it's only out matched by the delivery of delicious dishes. Can't stop eating the ratatouille.What a great addition to the French Quarter! I've enjoyed the other 2 locations many times. The crepes are delicious, with a good variety of choices. The staff is friendly and attentive. I recommend the restaurant to all my friends and family visiting from out of townAfter waiting in line for 20 mins, my wife and I were denied service because I have I service dog that I need with me at all times. Very disappointing to be denied when service dogs are protected under federal law.Stopped in on the recommendation of a local and holy hell are we glad we listened! Don't let the wait deter you - this place is 100% worth it! Friendly waitress, quick food prep, and fun atmosphere make French Toast all the better.
3 of our party of 6 ordered the chicken and waffles and it was amazing. Enough food to have been shared by the 3 of them but we all ordered separately and ate every bite. Perfectly fried chicken, soft fluffy waffles, and topped with sriracha butter & sweet syrup - perfect sweet and spicy combo. Coconut cream stuff french toast was awesome. Huge slice of soft bread was stuffed bull of sweet cream and topped with grilled pineapple and candied macadamia nuts. YUM.  Definitely worth the wait and the perfect fix to our first hangovers in NOLA.Went 1 mile to this restaurant,  only to find a note on the door that says 'closed due to hotel construction' which we saw no evidence of. Disappointed. Should have noted on maps or yelp.OK so I didn't try the french toast, crepes, or abelskivers. I went straight for the chicken and waffles and was so truly impressed, this will be the first breakfast I come back for here next time. Three perfectly seasoned, super juicy inside and crispy outside fried chicken thighs appeared on a bed of waffle quarters with a small side of cayenne butter. Menu says it comes with maple syrup but it is Dr Bill's cane and maple blend already on the table, a local made product that tastes wonderful with what you have plated in front of you. I spread on the butter, cut up the chicken over it, and poured on the syrup and was in bliss in about two and a half seconds. The best chicken and waffles I have ever found. Secret's out, you will be back.Great spot!!! Service was very polite and friendly. Got the breakfast sandwich which was: Bacon+egg+cheddar cheese on a biscuit.  Excellent. The coffee was really good too. I will be coming back for sure.After a quick shop around French Market, we had brunch over at French Toast and let's just say, we will be back here on our next trip into NOLA! Great staff, everyone was very friendly to us! Various brunch drink options, we ordered mimosas, Irish coffee and a latte and we were each happy with our drinks. The hubby got the Kings French Toast, and he is definitely a French Toast Connoisseur , and he absolutely loved it, just asked him again and he is pretty much drooling recollecting it. The bestest got the avocado toast with some bacon and she loved it! Now time for me! I got the fried oyster, corn maque avocado & egg toast and it was TRES DELICIEUX! Attached a photo, check it out, fried oyster, corn, avo, poached egg all on a bread... i mean that's perfection all served up on some toast :)Waited an hour for a table, waited a further 30/40 minutes for food, no forks on the table... food was alright but nothing special (perhaps it was our ordering though). It was ok, but wouldn't have waited all that time if we'd known the food was only so-so. Wait staff were lovely though.I really enjoy coming here. Everything we've ever gotten has been beyond expectations, especially for the price.of course I can make avocado toast at home, but for $8 it's really worth being able to relax and enjoy being waited on. The crepes are ridiculous!!!!! This was the first time ordering one, and dayyuuumm! They are huge, and decadent! The ratatouille sounds like it wouldn't fit in with the menu, but it works! They also have great breakfast cocktails. We definitely plan on making this a regular spot! Also, we put our name in on a Very busy day, and got seated earlier than expected. The service was also wonderful.Went her for breakfast on a Sunday and the place was packed.  We had gotten in line via the Yelp app so we had almost no wait.  The server was super friendly and attentive.  I had the Chicken and Waffles and, holy crap, they were AMAZING!  The chicken had this slightly spicy crust and was tender inside.  The waffles were great and came with a side of cajun butter that just put the whole thing over the top.  Don't miss this one!Delish!
In a town where you can literally have anything for breakfast, I was convinced I needed French Toast. So we roll in order a mimosa and then informed of the special-a waffle with lemon whip cream, blueberry sauce and strawberries. Sold. It was a yum. The hubs got a omelet and grits. His toast looked like a Grandma in the back was baking all morning-nice and thick. The butter in the table was room temperature(if your a butter expert like we are this is a BIG deal). If your in town, swing by. It doesn't hurt that the restaurant I'm connected to the Hotel Provincial.First time visiting this place. Found it on Yelp. Great food, customer service and atmosphere. I'll definitely stop back next time I'm in NO!!!A great place for either breakfast or brunch. I highly recommended that you use the yelp waitlist option when it's busy. The staff was very friendly even when it was busy. The location is easy to access from Decatur Street. You want be disappointed with the food or service.I had fried chicken and waffles Fried chicken was good, but waffles lacked crunch. Sort of gummy. Another person in our party had the croque madame, which was on two enormous pieces of gummy, flavorless bread that took away from the delicious eggs and ham. Doughnut balls were fun and delicious.This was a welcome surprise on our recent trip to NOLA! We haven't had the best luck at restaurants in the French Quarter and it can be such a pain to navigate, but I'm glad we took the chance and will certainly return during our next trip.
Do yourself a favor and get the aebelskivers. Not knowing what to expect other than them being described as "pancake balls", we went with the small order...and immediately regretted it after one bite. So, so good. I had the classic breakfast that I swear had more than two scrambled eggs. The grits tasted like they had some sort of cheese in them. I couldn't quite put my finger on what it was, but they were awesome. I prefer my bacon extra crispy and this was limp and greasy, but my husband had no trouble taking it off my hands. He opted for the fried chicken, pickles, and spicy mayo biscuit, which he promptly devoured. He said the spicy mayo was incredible. 
Neither one of us were huge fans of the biscuits. They were good, but heavy on the shortening. Service was a little snappy, but efficient, and while we were cramped being seated at the bar, we did get a cool view of the kitchen. Others have mentioned it, but it's true- this is a super small location. I would recommend using the Yelp feature to reserve a table. We didn't and had about a 30 minute wait. No big deal- we wandered around the Quarter- but if you're in a hurry, it's something to consider.The food was very good the service was exceptional we had a waitress her name was Whitney and she provided the best service I've had in a long time. I will return for the food but most of all the attitude of the waitress was phenomenal.
