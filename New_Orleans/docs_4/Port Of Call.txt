Great burger.  Perfectly cooked.   Huge baked potato.   Best drink I had in New Orleans all week.  - theyre monsoon.   Unreal.I've been eating at the Port of Call since 1969.  It's not a regular place for me but I go occasionally!  Today I had something happen which was a first! When I first asked a couple of questions, I perceived the waitress was a bit short to me lacking the usual good natured ness of the place.  I said nothing.  I ordered my salad with the dressing on the side as the tend to over do the potato toppings and salad dressings.  When thee waitress delivered the salad it was covered with dressing and I told the waitress I had ordered it on the Sid.  She bluntly told me, "no you didn't!" And I told he yes I did!!  She stated in a very sarcastic, curt manner that "I guess I'm not hearing anything!" Os something to that effect.
I am the most accepting person but her tone and repeated rudeness was enough and I decided to ask for the manager. I went to the bar and asked the lady working there to see the manager.  She said she would get him and I returned to my table.  My waitress came with a phone number written on a napkin and said the manager was not in but here was the number.  My friend decided to call and it ended up the number was foe a taxi company.  When confronted, the two said it was an accident they gave us the wrong number!
My waitress came to speak to me as did one other waitress to explain that we must have misunderstood the situation!!  I must say emphatically I misunderstood nothing!   
My point is to say, don't ever accept rudeness! I don't know what the problem was but it was not my problem the lady was evidently having a bad day and the manager was nowhere around.
As to the food, it was the best steak I've had there in a very long time!  It was moist and cooked the way I wanted it where in the past it was frequently excessively raw or cooked to the dryness and texture of old cardboard!  In all the years I've visited the restaurant, usually because friends wanted to go there,  within the past year I've noticed the staff getting less customer friendly and the food quality going down!  
I hope other visitors will review their experiences, and I hope my experience was an isolated one.  My visit was on May 28, 2013 at about 5PM.  The rating is for the overall experience.I am a big fan of a good burger, and I had a coworker tell me this was the best burger in NOLA. I have to admit, it was very, very tasty. I wasn't sure about this baked potato for a side, but it was so good too - definitely not microwaved. I would not bother with the bacon next time though - they were Bacos. Meh.
We will definitely go back because the burger was good and the potato - yum yum. But be prepared to wait a good long time. We waited 45 minutes on a Tuesday night.Do you want to get a good buzz going?  Get a Monsoon at Port of Call!
Do you want to get absolutely smoked by a drink?  Get a second Monsoon!
Since Port of Call is classified as a bar also, this review will be more about the great times i've had at Port of Call more than the burgers.  The burgers are great.  Big and juicy.  Actually they're really big.  The loaded baked potatoes.  Money also.  Worthy of 2 days worth of caloric intake.
That'll be the extent of my food review for Port of Call.  After all, it's classified as a bar on Yelp.  
I've had some random conversations with some random people at Port of Call because of the Monsoon.  The last time I made it to Port of Call about 2 years ago.  It was right after the Saints lost to the Dallas Cowboys to end the Saints' perfect season bid during their Super Bowl Championship run season (2009).
***NSFW monsoon induced conversation:***
Dallas fan (1 monsoon in):  "Who Dat?  We Dat!"
Dallas fan (1 monsoon in, looking at me):  "We're like the prom queen of NFL teams, everyone wants to be like us because of all the Super Bowls we've won.  Everyone wants a piece of this pussy.  The Saints are just the new kids on the block, who wants to play in the sandbox."
Me (1 monsoon in):  "No one wants old pussy!  You're the type of pussy that smells like rusty nickels!  The Cowboys are old pussy, stop living in the past, the Saints are new pussy!"
Dallas fan (1 monsoon in):  *Stares at me, and shocked at the vulgarity of what I just said*  Turns around all quiet.
Bartender got so crunk by what I just said decides to give me 2nd monsoon on the house.  
Feeling bad, I decide to share 2nd monsoon with Dallas fan.
After deciding to get another monsoon the conversation goes something like this I think.
Dallas fan (2 monsoons in):  "Let's go find some midgets and strippers"
Me (2 monsoons in):  "Sounds like a great idea, let's go".
***End NSFW monsoon induced conversation***
Oh, did I mention the burgers are really good at Port of Call?  Everything is served in excess size, but that's how we do in NOLA.  Geaux big!Port of Call has the best baked potatoes ever !!! It literally melts in your mouth. The burgers are really good too. (I would recommend medium or medium well)
Their signature drink ("Monsoon") is pretty good. You only need one !! The "Goombay Punch" is good as well; just like Rum Punch. 
This place is always crowded and depending on when you go, the wait can be over an hour.After opting to not get in a line that promised at least a one hour wait for dinner, we decided to return two days later after lunch rush hour. My husband ordered the cheeseburger and was very satisfied. I ordered a house a salad and baked potato. Baked potato was good and fulfilling. The salad, not so much--a small black bug crawled up and down, which completely turned me off from eating there period. The waitress didn't seem too shocked, which is the part that took me by surprise. The salad was taken off our ticket & our waitress apologized.Seems to me that Port of Call is the kind of restaurant...where you LOVE it and every time you go back, it's not as great as the first go.
That being sad, I love coming here, such an eclectic mix of ppl!  I wasn't a huge fan of the mushroom burger, kinda flavourless.  
But gosh, the burgers are huge and sooooo good!  But I still love my In-N-Out burgers.The food is great but gets quickly defeated by the negative dining experience.. Not sure if it's a general hygiene issue for the kitchen or the fact that people keep walking in and out of the place but as soon as my plate arrived so did multiple gnats that circled my plate. The place is also VERY dimly lit even for bar/lounge standards. Can easily become a 5 star establishment.So so so so good. If you're craving meat and potato, this is the place to go. Nothing fancy or healthy - just tasty deliciousness. 
I love Port of Call's dark atmosphere. Kind of like a pirate's cave. Some of that pirate gold would be useful to pay the bill with...Pretty darned good.  The burger was fantastic and the baked potato was really, really good.   Service was great and everyone was super friendly.   I can see why this place is packed.  Next time I am back in this area, Port of Call will be on my list of stops.BEST. BURGERS. EVER.  Love the fact that the burgers come with a baked potato instead of fries. Doesn't make you feel as guilty after eating a giant half pound burger. I'm sure there are other things on the menu but it's the burgers that will bring you here. A must visit if in the big easy.I love love LOVE this restaurant.I recommend going in the middle of the week to avoid the huge crowd and possible 1-2 hour wait.It's a very small place and it looks run down but the food is fresh and AMAZING and the atmosphere is always lively and comfortable.
Starting off with a "Goombay punch"(their version of a rum punch) is always the right move it's super delicious you can hardly taste the alcohol! But,don't get too excited and drink it too fast and only drink one because it will definitely hit you hard.Port of Call is known for their burgers but i love their steak dinners.First they give you 4 warm dinner rolls with a side of light margarine, then out comes a huge bright green salad with plump cherry tomatoes,green onions and your choice of dressing (I love their ranch).Then comes the juicy perfectly seasoned medium well Ribeye steak with a loaded baked potato.You can get the potato loaded with a mountain of cheese,butter,a dollop of sour cream,fresh cut green onion,bacon bits and if your over the top some saut√©ed mushrooms.All including the drink for $30.I totally recommend this restaurant to anyone who lives in New Orleans or anyone visiting this is a must eat spot!Seems like there is always a wait at this place. We came by just to grab a drink and there were a bunch of people waiting outside.
We couldn't decide which drink to get so the bartender let us try the different juices they use for the monsoon and port of call. Monsoon is definitely the way to go. The port of call was way too sweet. I felt pretty good after finishing one of these. A nice cold drink to walk around french quarter with.Their slogan should be "good food, no bullshit," cause they don't seem interested in your bs, and they certainly don't bs themselves--especially when it comes to their perfectly made burgers and potatos.
Throughout our talks with locals, we were left under the impression that this place is notorious for long waits, so we thought our best chance would be a monday night.  We lucked out--not only was it not crowded, but the group of four ahead of us on the list didn't have their complete party, so we got seated immediately.  An round of drinks was ordered, the menu considered for all of 2 seconds and when our waitress made her debut, she went through the table in about 30 seconds taking everything down and disappearing into the night.
Port of call makes it easy:  you get one of three steaks with a stuffed tater.  Prefer a burger? then they'll grind the steak into a patty and give you a damn burger with a stuffed tater.  You can get your burger with some combination of nothing, cheese and/or mushrooms, and you tater with those things and/or butter and/or chives and/or sour cream.  Did I mention that the MOST expensive this can get is about $13?
So we wait for our no bs burger and potato platters, and when they arrive, we're looking at one hell of a plate.  And you take a bite, and holy crap, they don't bs!  This is a burger made of quality steak, cooked to perfection, that tastes gourmet even though you're paying next to nothing and eating it in a dive bar.  This is a potato that that's tender and buttery and awesome.
Seriously--no bullshit.This is my favorite pre-French Quarter destination. The menu is simple. Steak burger. Baked potato. Beer. Mixed drinks. That's it!
The food has this strange appeal to it. I think calling it basic does it a disservice, but you can't call it fancy. The baked potato is the template on which baked potatoes everywhere were built. The burger is meat on a bun. There's nothing fancy or unique about it. I consider this a good thing. They don't need to have crazy or weird ingredients on too of their food or go out of their way to serve organic or anything. You don't care about that. You walk in. You sit down. You order a burger. You eat it. You drink. The end. 
Perfect.The best burger you will ever have, hands down. Go loaded spud and burger all the way. Simple and ridiculously delicious. Always packed but it's worth the wait every time! Make sure and try one of their famous drinks too, you get to keep the signature cup.I was told specifically to come to this restaurant and try the Huma Huma drink.  All I can say is dddddddddddddddddddaaaaaaaaaaaaammmmmnnnnnnnnnnnn!!!  That drink snuck up on me and had me tripping lol. I'm typically a bourbon drinker but I am 90% sure that the " Huma Huma" had some type of vodka in it.  I was down for the count lolAlways such a great place to go when I'm in town. I like it b/c it's not touristy like many spots in the FQ. Even when I lived in NOLA, I'd come to Port of Call for a great burger, drink and potato. It really stands the test of time- still as great as it was years ago. 
If you want to go somewhere that's divey but delicious, it's the place to go. Also, their drinks seriously will kick your butt! Probably some of the strongest drinks ever and in giant cups! I cherish my Port of Call cups at home and have several that I've kept for years. Trust me, it's worth the wait at this always busy yet incredibly delicious place! Make sure you try a Humma Humma!! Lastly, compared to many places in the FQ area, the prices are pretty darned decent, especially for the giant plate of food you get!Oh man, who doesn't like a burger served with a freaking baked potato? Their burgers are huge and their baked potatoes are so damn good.
Let's be real, if you're in NOLA, chances are you've been doing a lot of drinking. Feast at Port of Call before OR after all the partying, your body will thank you for it! 
You may be waiting in line for a bit but it's worth the wait. The vibe is extremely chill and if you don't finish your drink, they already serve it in cups to-go so you're all good there. Definitely stop by here if you're visiting NOLA!This restaurant was kitty corner from the hotel my hubby and I stayed at on our last trip to NOLA.  We were tired and hungry, and thought this would be an easy dinner stop.  We got there to find a substantial wait was in store, but didn't feel like walking somewhere else...thank goodness!  The food portions were not only MASSIVE, but absolutely delicious!  No wonder it was busy.  Even though there is good food all over, we came back here twice during our trip.  Great quality, wonderfully tasty food at a reasonable price...love it!Great burgers are a really fun place.  It is very crowded and the wait can be long but the food is delicious and so are the crazy drinks.  They are very good about getting the crowds moving.    They do need another woman's room.  Always a line.I avoided going to Port of Call for a long time, even though I've lived on Esplanade for several months, because it always was packed and even had people waiting outside. I reasoned that the crowd was a confirmation that the grub was OK and I had heard good things! Finally, the other day, on an early afternoon, I poked my head in before the rush and found it half empty so thought I'd stay and have a quick meal. I was pretty shocked at the prices, considering the divey interior: $27-30+ for a steak dinner (there are many charges for "extras" such as cheese) and $12 to $18+ for a burger and baked potato (again, many extra charges are possible to incur) so to be on the safe side, I went for the burger option, in my case a mushroom cheddar burger, no bun, with a baked potato and sour cream.  Although the restaurant was not busy, I waited for about 30 minutes before my order was brought and when delivered, it was not hot but lukewarm indicating either that it had been sitting around getting cold while I was waiting for it or that the chef can't cook. A medium rare burger only cooks for about 4-5 minutes so it has to be served right away while the outside is sizzling. If it is served after having sat on a plate for 10 minutes it is a lot like eating a vaguely warm lump of semi-raw meat - not nice. The baked potato served alongside the burger was also just a little above room temperature, so I don't know if they mass-bake these and then just churn them out or what, but it was not appetizing. Although bacon and chives are complimentary, I must say that I find it extremely excessive to charge $1.75 for a miserly tablespoon of sour cream. It was not enough for the size of the potato. I did speak to my waitress, politely, about my objections to the meal which I only ate half of and she comped my $6.00 cocktail. I took the rest home to heat up in the oven but it wasn't very nice the next day. Even with the discount it was $20 for a pretty disappointing luke-warm, half-raw burger and cold potato. I don't think I will give them another chance. My verdict: overrated, overcrowded and overpriced. Go to Buffas across the street for an excellent burger and awesome atmosphere!When you think places to eat in New Orleans, almost everyone thinks seafood seafood seafood; but this burger gem is located in the big easy.  I always go here every time I'm in New Orleans and have never been disappointed.
Pros
Burgers tasty and filling
Specialty drinks are killer; try the HUMA HUMA!
Cons
NO fries =(Listen to what everyone says and just give this place a shot. The burger could use a little salt but other than that it was great...AND HUGE. I shared it with my boyfriend and I soon wished I had ordered my own just so I wouldn't have to share. My bf said it tasted like a backyard burger from off the grill. So I guess that's a compliment. I noticed my fully loaded potato wasn't as "loaded" as the pictures posted on yelp. That was ok for me though because I really didn't need any more extra calories anyways.Despite the fact that the majority of reviews are from tourists (including myself), I would say that the majority of the people at Port of Call were locals when I dined for lunch on a recent Friday afternoon.  I ordered the mushroom cheeseburger, which for $13.25 is a little on the pricy side in all honesty, but the burgers are large and cooked well.  Perhaps the burger could have used a little bit more seasoning, but it is up there with some of the best I've had.  I'm nitpicking here.
Opted for a salad instead of the baked potato, but the potatoes looked amazing.  This was not on the menu, but offered by our server.
Worth the walk through the FQ.This is a really fun little, crowded place tucked away a block off bourbon street.  Not much on the menu; burgers & steaks.  The food was fabulous.  Great burgers, huge baked potato, great service.  After 2 days of Cajun & seafood, this really hit the spot.We walked in on a Friday around noon and got right in. This menu is VERY limited - burger, cheeseburger, baked potato, steak. Husband and I each had a cheese burger with baked potato, I had a Monsoon (which will get you buzzed half way through-very strong) and he had a small Monsoon and we spent $50. Pricey, good (not great).The burgers are alright, but the baked potato is amazing. Get it with bacon bits, chives, and cheddar. Would go back for the baked potato by itself.Port of Call is a funny restaurant because I don't think it ever meant to be cool - they just want to serve good food at a decent price. This they accomplish very well. I got the mushroom cheeseburger medium rare when I visited and enjoyed it tremendously - the burger was incredibly tender and juicy and cooked correctly. I threw some dijon mustard on there as well and it worked really well - although you may have a hard time telling the sauce bottles apart in the dark of the restaurant. They serve baked potatoes instead of fries, which as far as gimmicks go is very benign, and these are pretty tasty. I got mine with sour cream and chives and enjoyed it. 
My only complaint is that the restaurant is incredibly dark - I went in the middle of the day and it was dark as a cave inside. The menu is simple so you don't need a lot of light to read it but it still creates a weird ambiance. Maybe it's so you can trick over-hyper kids into going down for a nap. 
I'm sure I'll be back next time I'm craving a good burger.This place is a staple for when you come to NOLA.  More than likely, you will wait and probably wait a long time to get in or get seated.  That means you will probably have many drinks while waiting.  The food is good, but not amazing.  However, if you want to be around a good lively crowd that is all about having fun(including the sarcastic bartenders), this is the place to go.This place is perhaps the most well known burger place in New Orleans, I am not sure why its so famous but, well it is. The burgers are cooked to order, and are plenty tasty and juicy, the cheese however is not melted into the meat with the cheeseburger which for me is a failing and your choice of side is limited to a baked spud, no french fries on the menu. The drinks are priced well and its a little dive like decor wise. For sure its not worth the often long lines outside, especially for the price. For the best burger in New Orlean, I suggest Company Burger uptown.Great burgers and baked potato if you don't mind the wait. Last time we were there a creepy guy at the bar was taking pics of some college age girls and posting on Instigram.  Girls complained and bartender asked him to stop. Bartender knew him by name do he was probably a regular creeper. Employee took care of the issue though - good job.Port of Call is a great local dive & a welcome respite from the rest of the tourist throngs & pricey French Quarter meals.  It is a quick walk up Esplanade Ave. from the Quarter.  Yes, it's dark.  Yes, it's a tad dumpy, but that is part of it's local charm.  We did as Yelpers suggested & split a burger, which comes with a baked potato.  The burger was juicy & tasty, and the baked potato was light & fluffy & buttery!  Best baked potato I've had in a long time!  We added cheddar & sour cream to the potato and it came with a very generous serving of each.  The beer selection is ok, but it seems that the thing to do there is to order some tiki-inspired, strong but fruity drinks.  We had beer, but everyone around us had huge cocktails.  Lots of locals here, no tourists but us.  We had read about long lines, but we walked right in at 5:30pm with no wait at all. The meal itself took a little longer than expected to be served, but not too long a wait.  The place is tiny, but I like that they have a limited menu & do a good job at what they do make. A nice change of pace while in NOLA.This place is awesome. Monsoon is super strong. Burger is super good. Baked potato is amazing. If you're visiting NOLA you have to come here. One of the best meals I had during my visitFor everyone that says Port of Call has the best burgers in town, you need to get out more. The burger are not bad, but they are not the best in town. Read some of my other reviews for somewhere to get a truly great burger. The one thing that I do like about their burgers, is that they use shredded cheese instead of sliced cheese. for some reason I like shredded much better on burgers. But, I don't like the baked potato only option. Sometime fries help make a good burger and here you don't even have the option. 
But one thing that Port of Call does right are their drinks! I'm not sure whats they put in the Monsoon or the Huma Huma, but they are delicious. If you are wandering around the quarter, stop by the port bar and grab a go cup and keep walking. I have even made special drive by trips to the quarter just to pick up a monsoon! 
Also note, no separate checks.So, we'd been eating a lot of cajun and a lot of French Creole in New Orleans.  All okay, all awesome actually, but I have to say, somewhat tiresome.  You can't only eat creole, even if it is just four days, so as you can imagine, the cheeseburger craving set in pretty quickly.
I had read about Port of Call on yelp well before we visited NOLA.  I also remember noting that it was super close to our hotel, but as it is a bar with bomb cheeseburgers, I didn't put it on our list because quite frankly, a cheeseburger is something we can get in LA.  I was closely adhering to the while in Rome philosophy...
It turned out, however, that if I truly wanted to feel like a "Roman", I better find a kick ass bar, with some kick ass burgers, because trust me, real NOLA folk are not eating crab au gratin 3x a day.  After our swamp tour and a good 5 hours before our Commander's Palace reservation, our tummies were rumbling and we were dying for something not involving crab or butter.  Then I remembered...PORT OF CALL!
So, we walked the whole exhausting 2 blocks to Port of Call from our hotel, and hopped up on the bar stools.  I started off with some fun rum punch drink, and the bf got something called a Red Turtle.  Yummy cocktails, islandy, you know, sophisticated versions of your typical mai tai.  We also ordered two cheeseburgers and when we were asked how we want our baked potato, we both said "with everything?" Turns out getting it with everything was a stroke of genius, if I may say so myself.
Fast forward 20 minutes and out comes these mountains of cheeseburgers, piled high with the thickest beef patty ever, lettuce, tomato, onion, mushrooms and about 4 inches of shredded cheddar cheese.  I squirted on all types of sauces that were available at the bar, like mayo and bbq sauce, and of course, ketchup.  I then squished my burger down as far as possible and took the biggest little bite I've ever taken.  This is one mighty fine burger.  Mighty fine.
So, if you find yourself in NOLA just aching for all American food, and some islandy cocktails, this is your place.  Oh cheeseburgers...you may indeed be the best food on Earth.Great hamburger! Great cocktails! There was a line outside but we could easily find a place on the bar :)When my husband and I first moved to New Orleans, we were coming here about once a week.
This place is dark and small, and almost always has a wait. And it is worth it!
The menu is no frills, just some steaks, burgers, and baked potatoes.
The bar is sensational.. one tall drink can have you stumbling out the door.. and take one with you in one of their keepsake go cups.
But what I really want to mention, is the FOOD.
Get a cheeseburger and a baked potato.
They cover that baked potato in all the fixins.. including a mountain of cheddar cheese and sour cream. It's simple yet decadent and oh so good. My husband and I always split the burger and potato actually.. It's that big.
The burger is massive and full of flavor piled high with shredded cheddar and it is fresh.
Just go. It's great.It was the end of a long day of French Quarter Festing when we decided that the sun and the walking had gotten to be a little too much and we needed some serious food. This was more hunger than a sample from a fest booth could handle, so we wandered over to Port of Call, since I had never been and my PIC insisted that I try it.
We got here around 5 and, of course, there was a line. However, we decided to just wait for a spot at the bar to open up because I actually like sitting at the bar, and who wants to wait an hour for dinner? Sure enough, after waiting about 20 minutes, we were happily seated at the bar and ordering our food.
I got the cheeseburger topped with everything, including a nice pile of cheese and I got the baked potato topped with everything including bacon bits. The cheeseburger was delicious! Granted, I am speaking from the vantage point of someone who was starving, but I found it very fresh, cooked perfectly and "hype" worthy. The baked potato was good as well, but I think next time I won't get bacon bits only because they didn't really "do it" for me.
The staff here is super friendly and cool and, considering the crowd they are dealing with, they get to you really fast- we didn't have to wait to order once we were ready. Although Company Burger still holds onto it's spot for "Marielle's favorite NOLA burger",  I will definitely be back to Port of Call. I have yet to try one of those monsoons- once I made it here after FQF I was no longer in the mood for sugary drinks. Next time.The food here is great! I wanted a steak for my birthday and they did not disappoint. The salad that comes with it is massive and delicious, and I love the bread. The service wasn't great and I didn't love the atmosphere - it was very dark and loud, more like a standard bar - but the food was enough to still earn 4 stars!Love this dive! One of the best burgers I've ever had. Have been coming here for years and it never lets down. The 2-hour line around the corner on a Saturday night says enough. Noon-3 would be the best time. Was there earlier this week and was compelled to write a review because I was reminded why I keep going back, the food is simple yet so good.  The staff this time around was not the nicest but the food is worth the lackluster customer service. Perhaps, she just needed a break.The best burger of my life. Everytime I return and everytime they are fantastic. Served with baked potato, fully loaded is my favorite. The burgers are served on the rarer side so order one step up from the usually choice.  Long, long wait all the time. So make time for this stop
Watch out for the Monsoon's- much stronger than the Hurrican.This is a very good burger place. Not small but also not too big. The burger is charred just the right amount to give it a nice smokey flavor. Also, even if you order it well done, it's still juicy. It comes with only two additional options, cheese and mushrooms. No fries, just a baked potato.
I really loved that they hand-grated the cheddar. It just gives it a nice texture when you're eating it as opposed to using pre-shredded cheese.
The service is pretty curt. It's a very no frills place. Still, one of the better burgers I've had.One of the best burgers around. There's nothing fancy, just an abundance good quality ingredients prepared with respect. I see that at least one reviewer reports that the portions are small, but that was not my experience at all. The place is on the dirty side, but hey, this is Nawlins.
I've been there a few times, but my favorite experiences have been going there by myself and sitting at the bar. There's something about that place that just makes people friendly and open. The conversations I got into at that bar have been "colorful" to say the least. 
Order just one hurricane, and you'll be staggering out of the place. Their drinks would be illegal in Utah.If you are in New Orleans you have to stop by here and have the Huma Huma drink. The night we went here it was extremely packed but we were able to get our drinks in a  reasonable amount of time. This drink is will sneak up on you so its probably best that you don't try to drink more than one!This place has a very simple menu--steaks & burgers served with baked potatoes (no fries). They have limited choices, but they do it well!  I was a bit uncertain about the burger/baked potato combo but i was quite pleasantly surprised. If you want a HUGE juicy burger this is your place--especially if you like mushrooms, they serve a yummy mushroom burger!  Fun atmosphere and friendly service make it a great place to eat.I have searched far and wide for the best burger... THIS IS IT!   The flavor of the meat is incredible, perhaps because the meat is ground fresh daily . We order the burgers medium and they are always cooked to perfection.  
We sit at the bar, bartenders, Shay and Pat are amazing! They are witty and attentive, make fabulous drinks as well!
The establishment has dim lighting and is crowded with patrons waiting for tables and bar spots lined against the walls.... #tradition.  This is exacerbated with dismal weather! Embrace the experience!
There are no reservations, first come, first served ..., so when you are seated you deserve this experience, so enjoy!
If you are ordering to go please keep in mind the events going on around town. If things are quiet it will
Be fast and friendly. If you are ordering at a busy time expect a wait. Rest assured it will be worth it!!!
Love, love, sweet, juicy beef love... all I have for this place!This place is a joint but it serves the best damn burger I ever had and throw in the naked potato and you're in heaven.First time to NOLA.  Atmosphere was ok.  LOTS of honey booboo looking people and tons of douchbags inside.  You will know what I mean when you step in.  
The Mushroom Cheeseburger and Baked potato were good, however not the best.  Five Guys is definitely superior and has them beat by a huge margin, hands down.Monsoon + burger + baked potato = drunk food coma.
The Monsoon is so alcohol filled...that we always have seconds!! We now use the plastic cups at the lake and they are perfect!
The burger has been shrinking in size since Katrina...I can think of 2 size differences (getting smaller and smaller..) in the last few years.
The baked potato is the best darn potato ever. I come in from Alberta...Canada! Just to eat the baked potato.
Service is fabulous, the waiters/tresses, bartenders and all the staff are a total pleasure!! 
We have been coming here for years, and we will keep coming back.Port Of Call has, very likely, THE BEST burger I've ever had... and I search for "the best burger" everywhere I travel. I don't care that this place is a total dive and has mediocre - poor service. This burger knocks my socks off, and I can't figure out why. It's so simple, but it's absolutely perfect. The baked potato is really good too, but the only thing I would change is for them to offer real bacon as opposed to bacon bits. 
This place is a must for anyone who likes perfectly cooked, perfectly simple burgers.This place is like Sam The Butcher. It brings Alice the meat!! 
Although all I had was a burger, it was mighty tasty. I didn't go for the super stacked baked potato as we were just starting off the night and didn't want to overfill. So, word of advice, unless you want to be rolling down Decatur or Royal or Burbon, maybe consider splitting the burger and potato. It really is a lot of food. 
Anyway, back to the review. The burger was awesome!! Thick, cooked just right (medium for me) and juicy as a $12 Alaskan hooker. The only thing that is keeping this review from being a full 5 stars.... The wait. I realize that I was there during Jazz Fest, but it was a Wend. at nearly 10 O'Clock. So, if you do find yourself waiting an hour like I was, talk a stroll over to Cosimo's and have a beer. You'll be glad you did.All I can say is OFF THE CHARTS! One of my best friends told me i had to try it and I am so glad I did. It is an ABSOLUTE MUST if you are in New Orleans!As a vegetarian, I was skeptical when my friend insisted we go here on the merits of the baked potato alone. But I stood corrected - Port Of Call has a damned fine potato. Get it with the works (veggie peeps - they use bacos, so load it up!) and you will not be disappointed. Or hungry for a good 8 hours.The restaurant just opened up on a Saturday morning and we were able to walk right in.  The mushroom burger was fantastic, the potato was large and had bacon bits and chives.  Staff checked in 2 or 3 times to refill our sodas.  Great atmosphere!I give this place 5 Stars in the category of burger joints.  I loved this place.  For $11.00 I get a full meal. A good sized he pound burger with all the trimmings and a loaded baked potato.
You'll love this place.  Quiet, off the beaten path with an interesting nautical decor.Port of Call is located on beautiful Esplanade Avenue near the French Quarter. The restaurant is popular amongst locals and tourists. The restaurant is nautical-themed. They have tropical, delicious-looking cocktails. Service was a bit slow. The mushroom burger was a hefty sized burger. I thought the patty could've used more seasoning and unfortunately, the mushrooms tasted canned. 
The burger comes with a side of baked potato. You can add chives and bacon to your potato for free. Who doesn't enjoy baked potato? It is great comfort food. Overall, my experience felt mediocre. Nothing was amazing enough for me to proclaim that I am a fan. I have a handful of other burger places I'd go before going back here. However, I'm glad I got a chance to check out the popular Port of Call!My wife and I had so much fun at this amazing little bar. great food, great drink (dangerously great drinks) and very reasonable pricing! We hung out at the bar and were overwhelmed with the friendly vibe in this restaurant. Everyone was having a great time and this was one of our favorite stops while on vacation in New Orleans. I would definitely come back, and often.The food was not good and they charged $2.50 just to add sour cream and cheese and the baked potato. The burger was bland and the restaurant is dimmed in the inside. The monsoon was yummy but if you're in the mood for a good burger I would recommend 5 Guys instead.I've been waiting MONTHS to get back to port of call. This is my second time there. The owner (I think he's the owner) is the sweetest man ever! We sat at the bar and he gave all of my friends a shot on him! Not only that, he cut down the prices of the first round of shots.  Then out comes our amaaaaaazing burger and big baked potato. Wow, I might get it again before heading back to Ohio. This is seriously a place to go in NOLA. I highly suggest it!!I came here with some friends after my brother-in-law said this was a great place to check out in New Orleans.  We got there just after 12 and had ~1 hr wait, so don't come starving.
My husband and I shared the mushroom cheeseburger and a simple potato (~$13) with bacon bits and chives (other toppings cost extra).  The burger was fantastic...cooked medium, the perfect amount of cheese, and I loved the mushrooms.  The potato was pretty darn good too.  I ate most of the toppings and had to ask for more for my husband's half of the potato...oops.  I also had a goombay punch with coconut rum, and other fruity things.  The small size ($5.50) is served in a glass...I should've asked for a bigger size to go because I felt left out from all the other diners drinking from the big plastic cups with lids. :P
Service is pretty slow, so I wouldn't recommend this place for a quick meal.  If you have time for a leisurely lunch though, it's a good option.I have been here a couple of times trying to give them the benefit of the doubt. I would hear people raving about how awesome "Port of Call" is, but i have never seen what the big deal was. I am a local and i try to eat at local restaurants, lived around New Orleans all of my life. Let me start with the burgers, they taste like someone opened a large container of ground beef, portioned a thick patty and threw on the grill. No seasoning at all, they ask you what your preference for how well done its cooked. Pick one level higher it tends to be on the more raw side of the scale. The way they make there burgers are typical from every other burger joint. Now to the steaks, i will admit in the past i had an great fillet, but someone brought it home and gave to me, it was seasoned good and cooked the way i like it Med Rare to Rare. The Salad was good, make with buttermilk so it was thick and had great taste. The last time i went there i got a rib-eye, my stepfather got the fillet, i went to grab for the A-1 (Which i never put on steaks ) and he was already using it. Neither steak had any taste just plain meat. My wife said her steak was ok but she was also drunk from the strong specialty drinks they serve. I would have given 3 stars, but the place is very tight for room so you will be elbow to elbow with everyone or standing outside, Parking is a tuff so good luck, i guess the experience of the place and people make it better. One thing on its own and it kinda sucks. I guess i would recommend someone to eat here if they were in the neighborhood, but i wouldn't recommend if they are more then 2 miles away.Seriously you can not go wrong with this place. It is one of my local favorites and many others as well. Almost always a wait but definitely worth it.Great burgers, great atmosphere.  We love going here everytime we are in town.  Usually have to wait about 30 minutes for a table but its worth it.  We love starting off a Saturday getting all Monsooned up before we hit Bourbon St., highly recommend.Massive portions of food! I ordered the Mushroom-Cheeseburger with a baked potato and all the fixins' , was able to finish about 3/4 of my potato and about 4 bites of the burger haha Delicious! You get 4 stars from me and I would've given 5 had the waitress not told us our drinks were on the way and then proceeded to make us wait an additional 20 minutes before coming back over to the table and realizing that she had forgotten to ever bring us our drinks. We will be back for sure though.Best burger in the world hands down. A lot of people complain about a burger that is so simple, butt that's the beauty of port of call no frills, no gimmicks just kick ass burgersThis place is me and my people go to spot. The drinks are strong and good and the food is even better. The price is is on the high side but you get what you pay for and that is fresh meat. There burgers are really good and cooked to be juicy. The place is small so this is not really a weekend spot. Weeknights are slower than weekends so that's your best bet to get a good meal. Overall good quality.I couldn't think of a better venue!  My wife and I were here in January 2015 and had a delicious hamburger and monsoon.  The burger was cooked to order with a baked potato.  My wife and I both ordered the burgers and they were amazing!  There was a 30 minute wait for a table but if you were lucky enough like we were, we got a spot at the bar.  Bartenders were VERY friendly.
I would walk back just for the monsoon.  It was excellent.  I enjoyed the fact it wasn't in the Bourbon Street craziness either.  Great place, definitely worth the stop!The food is always good. Best burgers in town they say.  I would agree but, why get a burger if your visiting NOLA?   Hear there is a lot of big issues there as well from colleagues and friends.   Don't be surprised if you see rats running around while you eat in the dimly lit atmosphere.   There is almost always a wait as well.Hands down the best burger I've ever eaten! It made the wait in line, the flies, the cramped seating arrangements, and the slight smell of sewer seem trivial. I grew up seeing those huge Port of Call cups around the house but since it's not the most family friendly place in the world I was never taken on the monthly excursions. So Port of Call became a sort of taboo in my mind, needless to say I desperately wanted to go. Years passed and we moved but I never forgot about P.O.C. So last year on a family trip to N.O. I slyly suggested we take a trip to "That burger place I could never visit when I was 6". Finally after 15 years of waiting I tasted my first P.O.C burger and it did not dissapoint. I'm pretty sure the time spent longing for it served as a seasoning, but even without the side of lust it's a great burger. It comes with a baked potato (also delicious) and you shouldn't pass up the Monsoon it's better than the Hurricane in my humble opinion. Also keep in mind it's not a four star dining experiance, dress accordingly.If you love the idea of dunking a freezed potato in sugar water mixed with rubbing alcohol in a room that's so dark so you can't see the cockroaches walking around, THIS IS THE SPOT FOR YOU. If you are a horrible tourist, please, come here, stay forever, you have found your home and none of us want you anywhere that actually serves hamburgers.My review is for the restaurant only, I didn't have much experience with the bar area. 
I was totally "that person" and got the salad. Which, of course was done up in true southern fashion loaded with ham, cheese, lots of veggies and a soup bowl (seriously) full of Ranch. 
Friends got the burgers, perfectly smoky-no frills-big beef patties. 
Service was decent for how busy it was, and we were pretty packed in there- but there is less wait if you can fit more people inside. It's all about sacrifices people. Like sacrificing a burger for a soup-bowl of ranch.Great burger and potato.  Very simple and to the point.  Cool little spot that is definitely recommended.  Street parking can be a hassle.Got there at noon on a Sunday and the line was out the door. Waited about 45 minutes and it was well worth the wait. Fits the classic dive bar look and fell but that's what makes it all the better! Insanely tasty burger and potato (no fries). The Monsoon's are well poured and as others have said, one is all you need.  Definitely on the lunch list for every return trip to NOLA.Good food for the value. Service was a bit slow which surprised us because we got there before the wave. I'd rather eat here than the overpriced Mr John's Steakhouse.This is the best burger place in New Orleans, and one of the best places to get a steak.  We have been eating here regularly since we bought a place in the quarter right after Katrina.  The folks that work there immediately made us feel welcome.  We normally sit at the bar, and have rarely heard any complaints, save one time when folks had been there for a few hours and were asked to leave, and they left swearing.
Most of the complaints I have seen seem extremely unrealistic.  We spend about three months of the year in New Orleans, and eat there at least twice a week.  We have always gotten the burgers - which are big, exactly as we order them.  I have tried all the steaks they have, and as with my burgers, I like them medium rare - rare.  And I always ask the wait staff how I should order in order to get rare, as sometimes it depends on the chef.
Its an eclectic bar, and we always have fun being there.  The music is good, and we are always entertained by the various folks coming in.  We always try to get there early ( when they open at 11AM), which is part of the key to having a great time there.  If you only go when the crowds are huge, what do you expect  when your burger might be one of fifty coming out?  But always you will get friendly service, when you are friendly.
The drinks are relatively inexpensive, as is the burger.  The steak is a steal for the price, considering you get salad, rolls, and a great baked potato as you like it.  The Fillet is the best, and is fat and tender when rare to medium rare - don't complain if you get it well done and its smaller than the person's next to you.
When I see one and two star ratings, I pretty much just assume they are folks that either own other restaurants, or folks that were asked to leave.Amazing burgers and drinks. Real old school NOLA. Do not pass up this experience 
Real time burgersBest cheeseburger I've ever had. 5 stars.
Cooked medium rare and to perfection. Loaded with shredded cheddar cheese, fresh lettuce, tomato, and onion, you add all the sauces at the table. 
Definitely will be back when visiting NOLA again.Not impressed. Burger was dry and not flavorful. Baked potatoes had imitation bacon bits and lots of toppings. Had a better burger at yo mamasSuper tasty burger, nice baked potato, good drinks.  The vibe is pleasantly divey, service was a bit too restrained to match with the rest.  A little odd that there are no fries, but you can still get your potatoes baked.
