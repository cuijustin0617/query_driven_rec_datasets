We were walking by and decided to try the veggie stuffed potato.  It was big and very good.Went to this place off of a recommendation from a friend. I was told this was a "healthy sandwich shop." Upon arriving and looking at the menu to find that they had red beans, all the idea of eating healthy flew out of the window. As far as health food, this is far from being terrible; but it's not all that healthy either.
I ordered the whole cheesesteak and had them take off everything except peppers and onions. I was surprised to see how big it was (that's what she said). I ordered to-go and when I finally bit Ito the sandwich, I tasted a bit of heat. They had jalapeño peppers in there as well. At first, I was a little upset because I only wanted bell peppers and onions; not even realizing that they would even add jalapeños. After another bite, I kept wanting more. It was the perfect combination of spice and savor. So good, that o had to go back!
The reasoning for the four star rating is because of the slight smell of sewerage at the front door. I wouldn't attribute that to the kitchen though as the smell is terrible in that whole area of town. *womp, womp*5 stars around the board. Good customer service (which I always harp on), GREAT food. Everything is fresh -- one thing though, they don't fry anything. So no fries, etc, but they do have chips. My boyfriend got the lamb burger on hoagie bread, which came with chipotle sauce, tomatoes, Gouda cheese, and lettuce. I got the chicken quesadillas, which was laid out in a nice presence and were DELICIOUS. The woman at the counter showed no hesitation to explain what was on the menu, and also share her favorites. One thing she did say, EVERYTHING is good, and from the two things I've tried on the menu, I'll be coming back for more!I was really interested in this place because everything just looks so different and delicious. I visited this place twice to check out a variety of their menu. 
I came here with a friend for the first visit and it felt like the cashier did not want to be there. He may have had a bad day or something. My friend and I ordered the Salmon and Shrimp Loaded Baked Potato, Salmon Sub, and Shrimp Quesadilla. Everything looked great, but the food was generally a little too salty and greasy. 
For the second visit, I went by myself for some takeout. A lady took my order this time around and she was much nicer than the other guy. I ordered the whole N.Y. Style Cheesesteak with white bread, 2 Lemon Pepper Wings, and 2 Jerk Flavored Wings. The lady informed me that the wings were baked and not fried, which was a nice FYI. The N.Y. Style Cheesesteak was pretty greasy and had a lot of mayo, but was my favorite thing from here so far. The wings were just okay, they could have used a bit more flavor. 
Overall, this place is a decent spot to get something different and a quick lunch before returning to work or class. Everything is made to-go and the portions are pretty filling. There is no parking lot, but you can find street parking on Tulane Ave.Went here to grab dinner to go. Place was empty. When we got home the wings were dry and obviously had been sitting for hours. Red beans were dry, too. Disappointed as had tasted a chicken plate of a friend before,  and it was tasty, the reason for trying them on our own.Legit local spot with delicious and creative takes on sandwiches. Located at the low-income black bulwark of Banks and Broad, this location is a holdover from a time past when Midcity was a little less hipster. The Philly Cheesesteak is nothing like its namesake...but it might taste better. I recommend no jalapeños. Service is slower than slow, which is why I docked a point. Food is five stars. So is price...one "whole" sub is more than 20 inches...I review places based on if I would ever go back. I had a groupon that brought me there. The  Philly cheese steak sandwich was good and the portions were great enough to feed two for the large. Definitely going back!! Quick tip if you're not in a rush definitely go there.  If you're rushing you may want to call and order ahead.I recommend their Salmon sandwich & salads are delish!!! And its different :) First time this weekend & i enjoyed itGreat Food,at a Great price. When you walk in your greeted with a smile. With lots of space to even have a Meet & Greet..But I went for the food.ITS A MUST GO people.Great place. Nice atmosphere and great music. The cashier was very friendly and patient. He made great recommendations. Everything was delicious. I'll definitely be back.Everything is so delicious and fresh! Fat girl dance worthy!! Staff is very friendly. You can dine in or place an order to go. They're also on Uber Eats. Sit and watch the game while you wait or talk to friendly customers. I'll definitely be back.Just simply awesome.  I ordered a salmon burger.  A slab of fresh salmon grilled to perfection. An added sauce that had me humming. My twin ordered salmon subway.  All the fixins of a subway.  2 six inch subway sandwiches for under $15. She took half home for dinner
Place is nicely decorated and very clean.  Will be a regular. All kinds of good meAts such as lamb, turkey, wings.This place was awesome. The people were friendly and the food was great. The portions were hefty, for affordable prices.Been here a bunch of times. I have to say, they are intolerably slow, and pricey for what you get. They had 1 order ahead of us, and those people have eaten and left and i'm still waiting on a salad and a sandwich. 30 minutes! Slack.The grilled chicken salad was delicious and the portion size was worth the money.  The Jamaican meat pie was spicy, fulll flavor and very tasty.I absolutely love Mr. Everything! Every time I visit the location everyone is so friendly. I'm always greeted with a smile and a "welcome back". The food is always cooked fresh to order and is delicious. I will say one of my favorite things is the shrimp bowl with yellow rice. Don't skip the fruit punch or lemonade both drinks taste amazing! Thanks Mr. Everything I'll see you next time!I had the salad, with salmon. Best salad I've had in a while. Very filling. Cook a and cashier were very nice. I'll definitely return to this place to try more things.I live close by and always meant to run in. Let me just say, my food was 5 stars. Took a while to be ready, but they don't advertise to be fast food and I wasn't in a major hurry anyway. It took maybe 15 minutes. I got the grilled chicken rice bowl. Lots of veggies, well seasoned chicken, mixed all together and it was great. I ate all of it, minus the rice for only dietary reasons, right there. The -1 star is for the girl taking my order. She wasn't especially friendly during the ordering process but I tipped her 20% on my to go order. Whatever. When my food was ready, she called my name, handed it to me, I said my warmest, kindest "thank you so much" and was not even met with eye contact. Incredibly rude, especially to a low maintenance, nice-tipping customer who asked nothing of you. I'll come back but just because the food was great.Their rice dishes are awesome. Great balanced lunch that leaves you full but also includes plenty of veggies.I've stop here twice now and the only way the describe  the food is delicious. Won't be done super quick, but it is well worth the wait.This place came recommended by two good friends of mine who's taste in food is highly trusted by me. After weeks of it being in my bookmarks, i finally made my way down to Broad and Bienville for one of those world famous grilled chicken sandwiches. The wait was brief, but the goods were every bit of goodness! 
I ordered the whole because i was told it could serve as two meals (depending on how hungry you are, you could probably do it all in one sitting). It's been a couple weeks since my first visit but as i'm revisiting this place and my experience in my head, i think it's time for another stop in. 
Saints game is on tho, it'll have to wait until halftime :) #WhoDat!Let me preface my review with the fact that the food is very very good. The menu overall is healthy and that's much appreciated in a city like New Orleans HOWEVER the portions are way off for the price. To receive a medium size container and there is barely any rice, large veggies and a handful of shrimp is very disappointing. I am currently en route to find more food because at $14 the rice w/ shrimp did not fill me up. Rice is the cheapest thing you can purchase. Seriously can you add one more cup of rice and make your portion a bit more filling??Excellent food!!! I just wish they had bigger portions, we had to order 2 plates!! Overall, sweet staff and most of all, excellent food! Salmon burger was amazing!I was hoping to Love this place, as I love to support  small local businesses, unfortunately I do not recommend it... the bell pepper that was cooked in my yellow rice shrimp dish was old as it was a different color green and being from New Orleans and cooking all my life I could tell the difference.  I inquired about the  the steak and shrimp and ultimately decided on the steak but received shrimp instead?? Maybe because the shrimp dish is more expensive for maybe 6 shrimps in the entire dish... the yellow rice was cold and was very bland as if it was warmed in a microwave but the toppings such as the broccoli spinach etc where grilled hot?   Very dissatisfied with the food, yet the service was ok.    I waited about 15 minutes on my food, and they honored the 10% coupon from yelp.They take a while (fifteen min wait for gumbo and grilled cheese). But the food is worth it. The pros: 
1. No Pork in anything! So got to have gumbo and red beans for the first time ever in New Orleans (I have had them elsewhere, and also cooked them myself also). 
2. Black Owned- High quality biz owned by a black family. Great to support our black biz owners.
3. Great Service- The time should NOT be a problem for anyone who can READ, as they have a giant sign (with font larger than the font on the menu hanging next to it) that details that everything is cooked to order and that as a result, there will be a wait. I suspect the courthouse crowd are the ones complaining about the wait. I had no problem with my wait, and I think a 30 min lunch break would be enough time as long as you are nearby.  
4. Plenty of parking. 
5. DELICIOUS FOOD!- Everything was well seasoned and yummy!Ordered a loaded chicken baked potato and got blocks of potatoes and blocks of chicken with broccoli and some nasty stuff I think was cheese over top?? Would never go again.I ordered food for my family and when we had a delivery issue, both the employees and manager went out of their way to make sure things worked out. The food was decent but the service was superb. I am really impressed with them and would eat here again. I had the salmon with brown rice. It was good but I added some creole mustard to give it a bit of a kick. Overall great experience and I found many options for my dad who has health issues and eats a special diet.Mr. Everything is sweet and welcoming, and his kitchen is doing it right. Best wings I've had in a long time, and he's only using healthy, natural chicken. His whole thing is using prime ingredients to make soul recipes. Sandwich we got was delicious too-- Can't wait to go back. Support this little place-- It's one of those that I hope grows strong and becomes an institution, because I like the people behind it, the food and the message.Very good food. I've been here many times. The prices are reasonable and the staff is pleasant. Mostly I have either the cheesesteak or the quesadillas. They have really good fruit punch too.The worst salmon burger ever, also get rid of the young lady at the register. I'll never go back and would never recommend waste of $21 and my time. It says salmon burger not salmon salad burger. Her attitude match the burger nasty. No more to say.So good!  He really does have everything. The salmon sandwich was scrumtralescent. The healthy rice dish (which was blanketed in cheese) was delicious and oh so filling.  You might be able to feed a small family with that dish alone.
Just a fair warning - beware of the fountain drinks (aka koolaid cooler).  I came on a hot summer day and ended up drinking about four cups of lemonade.  It was so good but I'm pretty sure it almost put me into a diabetic coma. Learn from my mistakes and pace yourself!Arrived at 2:45pm for a quick lunch. Quick is the wrong thing to think of at this place. there were about 6 people walked in after me as when I arrived only 2 people were here. I placed my order and didn't get my food until 45 minutes later. The owner and cooks constantly were in conversation and there was no sense of urgency to get anyone's food out besides when it finally arrived no apology for the amount of time it took to cooks a Salmon Burger! This is yet the second time I've come here but this is the worse service. I definitely will NOT be back and if you're someone who has a schedule refrain for planning this into it. It will throw your day off. Horrible expediting of food and horrible customer service.Been going here for years but my last and final time here was horrible. I got food poising hours later after eating.. this was the only thing I ate all day so I know for a fact it was the Salmon yellow rice dish. Food was good going down but I should've know something was wrong when the salmon wasn't pink. I DO NOT RECOMMEND eating here. There over priced as well and very slow . Save your money and your time  !!!Updated my review to confirm that, while I reIocated to Oregon in 2017, I was living and working in New Orleans when I wrote the review ... so it's not a "disgruntled tourist" review!
Having driven past this cafe many times, I decided to give it a try on my lunch hour. The menu looked interesting, but I had to wait almost 10 minutes to place my order because the girl on the counter had stepped out (-1 star). My order was straightforward - a vegetarian sandwich - but I had difficulty understanding her questions which were mumbled. When I asked her to repeat, she became impatient (-1 star). When I paid,  there was no thank you and it took another 25 minutes for my half-sandwich to be prepared (-1 star). It was finally handed to me in a brown paper bag that was oozing grease from the bottom, and by the time I got back to my office, what I unwrapped was a soggy disaster of unidentifiable vegetables, melted cheese that had stuck to the wrapper, and liquidized bread. I had to eat what I could salvage with a fork (-1 star)
Others obviously had more positive experiences here, but the combination of multiple negative factors would prevent me from giving them another try. Too many excellent cafes in this city to waste my time and money.I'm never disappointed when I go here. I usually get the shrimp salad (add salmon). It's very tasty and filling. The staff and cook are also pretty pleasant. I'll continue to support this business and I encourage others to give em a try.This is not a good restaurant they don't support that people they pay him minimum wage they pay him less than minimum wage and they started funky ass food it's all right but it's still funky that mother f***** what are disrespectful as a mother f***** f*** that mother f***** pleaseLove this place.. kind of a hidden gem in this area. Usually go with the New York cheese steak but wings, red beans and Jamaican patties are all deliciousI had the salmon yellow rice dish..I think I ordered the wrong thing ! It wasn't bad, I'm just not a fan of fried rice , plus it needed more seasoning .
I'll give this place another try eventually.Never heard of this place and stopped purely by chance. Ordered the yellow rice with lamb on suggestion of young lady at counter.  Got my takeout after 15 minutes and left. When I got back to work and saw my plate I was surprised by the quality of the fresh vegetables and generous portion. Best of all it was extremely good. The yellow rice was cooked perfectly with slices of gyro meat, diced tomatoes, red peppers, broccoli, mushrooms topped with wilted spinach and a little  cheese. It was all seasoned amazingly well. Several people told me how good the Jamaican and vegetarian dishes were. Going back for more soon. Only downside is lack of parking.The staff was very helpful and knowledgeable of the menu. It was my first visit and they were able to recommend and describe their recommendations, in a precise manner. Only downside is, I ordered chicken, but got beef. I live too far to return and the beef is quite tasty. Next time, I'll make sure it is chicken. I will return.I'm am so done with this place. I've tried to support local business, but this local attitude I'm over. The guy taken the order act like he's a paying for your food that your ordering. He does not take feed back well.  Every time I order something is wrong. He has horrible customer service, will argue you down about your food being wrong. Instead of just fixing it and moving on. The Salmon burger is a joke, they give u pieces of salmon and call that a burger, the excuse is that " it allows them to cook it down better".  What is the point? The Salmon has NO season to it. I've never had any problems getting salmon burgers from anywhere else, and all of them were cooked through. The food has no flavor and not worth it. Over priced and cheaply made, no creativity to food. $10 for Salmon pieces...?? It's not even enough to cover this large bun. The customer service is terrible, attitudes are horrible, it's not worth the time or money spent to support this business...Mr. Everything's is yet another example of how the eateries around the courthouse are stepping up their game. When we walked in, we were pleasantly surprised to see that this was not just one of the filthy greasy-spoon-type places that used to plague this area. Granted, it's no fine dining hall restaurant, but it appeared to be very clean and sanitary. 
I had the Queens Style Gyro, which was delicious, but a little heavy. My friend had the Lamb Rice Dish, which he also enjoyed. My only complaints would be that (1) the food seemed to take a long time, given that there were not many people in the restaurant; and (2) many of the dishes seemed to contain A LOT of the same ingredients. I would have liked to have seen a bit more diversity. Overall, I'd recommend this as a good lunch spot.Definitely one of New Orleans' best kept secrets! We enjoyed a chicken rice plate that included loads of deliciousness and fresh ingredients! The okra gumbo was jam packed with meat and flavor! The portions were generous and the price was sweet. We will definitely be stopping by frequently.*Update - Mr. Everything Café gave me a full refund for the order I placed, thank you. I would give Mr. Everything Café and second chance to redeem themselves!
Grilled chicken, brown rice, broccoli and a sweet potato, this was the meal i ordered through Uber eats. I've ordered multiple times and I've always asked for them to send a regular potato instead of a sweet potato and it's never been an issue. Unfortunately tonight it was and i did receive a sweet potato, which was not a huge deal. However i did receive a heaping mound of tomatoes on top of my entire dish. I hate tomatoes and no where in the food description does it say it includes tomatoes. Whole meal right in the trash, what a waste and a let down I really liked this place.Everything on Mr. Everything's menu is delicious! I definitely recommend this place for healthy eating .I really use to love this place, now i won't ever go back the vegetables were burnt the shrimp were burnt the rice was hard and the whole meal was trashPeople were nice. Food was cooked to order.  It didn't take to long. it was good,Very good. Can't complain.This place is great! My bf and I went last weekend with a Groupon and definitely will return. Their portion sizes are great, the restaurant is nice and clean, the workers are polite, and the food is sooo good. We got the NY Style Cheese Steak and the Red Beans and Rice w/Wings Plate. First off, the Cheese Steak was beyond amazing. Such a unique flavor, a thousand island style of dressing I believe. And the red beans were served with yellow rice. I've never had them like this, but man were they good. Wings were super yummy too. Fall off the bone tender. Very happy with our experience. Thanks!Where to begin, Reuben sandwiches are supposed to be overflowing with corned beef and sauerkraut especially if the sandwich is called the King Reuben. When the delivery arrived I was surprised to see a sandwich that was not even an inch thick. This thing looked like it was run over by a Bradley tank and left to sit in the hot sun. The bread was not rye but wheat (I'm considering this a mortal sin) also the culinary genius that made it decided what the hell let's not add the Thousand Island dressing we obviously are skimping on sandwiches today. So after a second thought I decided to call Mr. Everything to see if he would fix the situation, and what do you know; the not so helpful lady at the end of the phone was obviously just a talking piece for an owner that really has no customer service skills. Defending a sandwich that did not have the hearty flavor and size of a real Reuben (this was not a Reuben it was two extra thin slices of meat between sub par wheat bread), her boss the owner didn't really seem to care. But I would expect that if he watches his food leave the restaurant like it did this obviously shows he's not that concerned. I Noticed a few of the menu items described as New York and Queens style. After spending fare amounts of time in the city that never sleeps I can tell you that this just would not fly. It is what it is, and I've learned a valuable lesson Mr. Everything wants your dollar, but doesn't want to offer quality.Good food but horrible customer service!!!  There are too many restaurants with good food in New Orleans to be treated so rudely.  Will never spend money here again.The stuffed potato was EVERYTHING! See what I did there? ;) Super yummy and very filling. The patties were ok, the potatoes definitely made up for what it was lacking. The staff was great abs super patient with all of my questions! :)Last month, a came here with a group of friends. I really didn't want to come considering I had read the reviews but I did. I ordered the small philly cheesesteak which was around $9 I think. I was not impressed. Although the flavor wasn't bad, there was hardly any meat. I was hoping it would be way too much meat that I needed a fork to eat what had fallen out of the bun. So not the case. I could not even see the meat when the sandwich was closed. But whatever. Others had similar experiences with their food and were not impressed. However 2 people both had the turkey burger and both said it was really, really good. 
The service was not bad but it could have been much better. We planned to dine it since there were tables but we were not asked if our food was for here or to go. We all received our food in bags but we dined in anyway. 
I don't have much energy for this review but just go someplace else if you want a decent experience. The food wasn't costly, it just didn't compare to what I could have gotten next door, across the street, or down the block for the same price.Went in on Saints game day... the atmosphere was very nice especially for a game day. They seem to have a nice menu which is good. We didn't dine in but we waited for our chargrilled oysters while we watched the game. We took our order to go. Unfortunately the oysters were over cooked and not much seasoning. I will however go back to try other items on the menu. I do believe in second chances.Food Exceptionally good and always fresh, it's your local spot in New Orleans food is made fresh to order and it's a place with Healthier choices of food.Mr Everything is a personal favorite of mine.  I enjoy a variety of dishes on the menus, but my favorite is the turkey burger.  The food is made to order so be sure to allow some time for them to prepare your food.Having driven past this cafe many times, I decided to give it a try on my lunch hour. The menu looked interesting, but I had to wait almost 10 minutes to place my order because the girl on the counter had stepped out (-1 star).

Others obviously had more positive experiences here, but the combination of multiple negative factors would prevent me from giving them another try. Too many excellent cafes in this city to waste my time and money.Never again they took 40 min for a salmon burger the women behind the counter was rude idling this is how New Orleans service is visiting from California but dam 9 dollars for a soggy ass sandwich burger with know fries excuse my LangEdk y8yr. 7siuv97v97v07c9uo fu 0ivip gi. Vy8ftod56fuefj,uc06g. vy8yvitc. hgu9vum. hiho0ub8 u y8f686f9cy8h.Easily the best Lamb Gyros I've ever had. Perfect blend of sauces and flavors. My family did have to wait for a while to get our food but it was definitely worth the wait in the endSince this is my first stop in New Orleans, I don't have much to compare the food to but I left satisfied. I thought the red beans and rice were excellent with tons of great flavor and I thought the wings were good but a little over cooked and not crispy like I expected. The customer service was amazing and a great way start to our vacation. Overall, this place was good and makes me excited to try all the other food here.Best cheesesteak I've ever had.  Wings are great, red beans are great.  Love this placeThis spot was amazing! I been wanting to try it and heard the great words of how much you get when you order I went with the chicken rice plate. When I tell you my lunch was my left overs for dinner as well with how much food I have gotten from them. They stated it was a healthy option I would say so myself but it was slightly oily for my tasting. Coming back to try their stuffed potatoes next time!Customer service : Poor
Food : Okay
Atmosphere : Okay
TLDR; Service was horrible. Wouldn't come back. 
See below for my experience. 
Attempted to call to place an order ahead twice. Straight to voicemail the first time and the second time they didn't pick up. 
Heard great things about the food so took a trip out there during my lunch break to try the food. 
Placed an order for one (whole) cheesesteak and a grilled lamb yellow rice dish. Was told it'd be 30 minutes, so I waited. And waited. And waited. About 3 RTA busses came and gone. At this point 45 minutes elapsed and I got restless, wanting to be gone myself. Walked up to the counter and was handed my cheesesteak and told "thank you". After asking about my yellow rice dish, turns out they forgot to put it in. Was told 5 minutes and it would be done. 
Sat around for another 5 minutes debating on asking for a refund, but gave them the chance. 8 minutes pass and I'm already late for work, and with a cheesesteak getting cold in a bag. Walk up to the register, ready to ask for a refund on the yellow rice dish, and the person at the register refuses to look at me. Just stands there with their back to the register, looking at the kitchen. I wait a minute and see my rice being microwaved (cooked to order baby). Another couple of minutes and I'm handed my order in a bag without so much as a word. 
Overall it took an hour or so to get my food, double the 30 minute estimate. 
Food was alright, nice and room temperature because Mr. Everything serves it that way.This place is a jewel. One of few places I can eat guilty free and feel satisfied! My go to is the salmon, spinach and brown rice. Please bring the sweet potatoes back!Because it was one of a few places in the area of my job that had seemingly healthy items, I gave this place a try again after several years of leaving it alone. A coworker and I wanted gumbo since the weather became chilly and the line at Broad and Banks where I usually go was too long. I'd stopped going here years ago because of the long wait time even when calling in an orders. The items I used to purchase were decent, pricey but large servings so it balanced out. This time when we'd gone, it was not the case. We ordered a gumbo listed on the menu as a large which was the only size so not sure why large was even mentioned and the large is the small at other places I've been. 12.00 for it. We gave in and still ended up waiting 20 minutes for something Id assumed had to be already prepared. The gumbo advertised crab, shrimp, turkey sausage. When we got the gumbo, gumbo it was not. This was more like slimy stewed okra with bits of sausage, bits of shrimp and no crab at all. Will not be returning. If you visit, the sandwiches and plates are what they do best such as the salmon sandwich or salmon with yellow rice, etc.Sandwiches were just ok. The chicken gyro lacked a lot of sauce. And it had mushrooms. Weird. The deli sandwich wasn't anything worth trying. Perhaps because I tried Mr. Everything Cafe by way of delivery, my experience was sub par.This place just makes me happy. The food is so good and so humble. The prices are great. My guy and I come here before movies sometimes, and we both love it. The red beans and wings meal is delicious. Also the NY cheesesteak is decadent and divine. Also, the workers are nice and the music on point.I ordered the Salmon plate from Uber Eats & it was EVERYTHING to Me!  Soo fricking FYEWent in with only one person in line in front of us, ordered and waited 45 minutes. They hadn't even started making our sandwich after that time so we leftI really wanted to like this place.
The prices are decent, and it was almost empty when I arrived.
I placed my order and waited with 2 hungry toddlers for our food to arrive.
It took 30 minutes for our dishes to arrive and although I had ordered it
to go, was brought to me all tied up in a bag in styro containers.
My children by this timer were HANGRY, so I picked up my food and kids and went home to eat.
I had the Gyro sandwich which was not too bad, not too good, but not too bad.
My children split a Chicken Quesadilla, which although substantial in size, was pretty soggy.
I found the culprit, they grilled it with lettuce inside.
You NEVER grill lettuce, it gets soggy, wilty and pretty gross.
It also makes everything around it equally as sad, ergo the soggy quesadilla.
Overall, not a good experience.
I will go back for one more shot.
Maybe Mr Everything, has bitten off more than he can handle food wise.
Maybe he should scale it down to "Mr Somethings" and focus on quality and service.
That's my take on everything considered, for Mr Everyrthing.Always a pleasant visit, food is delicious. I frequent this place for their turkey burgers and lamb rice!When I saw they served no pork, I knew I had a winner! 
I went on April 29, 2015, with my boyfriend. I saw their menu online and was intrigued by the options. I think I was sold when I saw turkey sausage and turkey bacon. Honestly, the only time I get turkey sausage in my gumbo is when my mom cooks it! I'm not a pork eater and being able to come to a restaurant that doesn't serve pork (or fried food) is amazing. Well, in New Orleans anyway!
I had the rice dish with shrimp, and my boyfriend had the rice dish with chicken. It was well-seasoned,filling, and reasonable priced! Plus, your food is prepared in full view!
The restaurant is clean. The staff is nice and welcoming. The chef even asked if we enjoyed our meal. I loooveeeee the music ('90s R&B...YESS). I'm taking my friend there today, and probably going back this weekend. Thanks for having healthy options WITHOUT skimping on taste!The service was horrible. The food was greasy, and we witnessed the man seasoning chicken in the sink with no gloves. Owner was rude when told about it and the wait was long despite the fact there was hardly anyone in thereDo not go to this place! They are over priced and the food is not worth it, I ordered a BLT for $10+ and got this (see photos). You can make a better sandwich at home. Don't waste your moneyApparently they don't pay their employees! I wouldn't patronize anyone that doesn't value human beings enough to pay them for the work they do. I tried to help two of my friends collect a weeks worth of pay they were owed but, Mr. Everything a.k.a Ronald Walker wouldn't even speak to me. First he tried to pretend he didn't know who Ronald Walker was until my friend pointed him out, and sure enough it was the same guy I was talking too! What a coward. Don't give him you money, you can go right next door to Broad and Banks or Ideal supermarket and get amazing food from businesses that have been in New Orleans for decades, and actually pay their employees. You can expect that summons soon Ronald. We aren't just going to let it go!Took 45 mins to make a shrimp baked potato - cost 11.50
Got it, was shrimp on top of rice. The order took so long that I didn't want to wait another 45 minutes. Also, it taste like a TV dinner. 
My friend ordered the salmon quesadilla, took 45 mins to make it. When he got it it was chicken and the cook argued it was salmon. When the salmon was 4 dollars more.
Never in life will I go back. 
The cashier at the front is not friendly and this place has zero customer service skills ! 
I spent 33.00 on crap food, crap service. 
Thanks Mr. Nothing!Salmon subs is utterly amazing. I didn't expect it to be as good as it was. The vegetables are sautéed to perfection and the salmon is not dry. I hate dry overcooked salmon. The only down side of this restaurant would be the parking situation. It's hard to find a spot to park at times. Other than that, I have no bad things to say! Sorry for the sad picture of the Salmon sub, but it was so good I forgot to take a picture and by time I remember this is what it looked like.I NEVER write reviews on any restaurant because i feel like people that write reviews are petty and may have been picky for the wrong reasons. Today i spent $65.00 on an uber order from "Mr. Everything." I ordered a club, a philly, a "NY style cheesesteak" , a random steak and rice bowl, and some wings. The wings were not cooked and still pink inside, the only good part about the rice bowl was the rice, and I'm afraid to ever know what the meat was. I took a bite and spit it out, tried another bite from a different sandwich and also spit that out. thanks. The cheese steak was soggy and probably was not a meat that should be cooked, and/or legal to be cooked. and made me wonder how my city, new orleans, could have a restaurant this bad without being shut down. Mr. Everything should have been called Mr. ONE STAR CAT MEAT GARBAGE, and once again i will say that i work at a restaurant and order uber all the time and eat all over the city from hole in the walls to 5 star restaurants to gas stations and this is literally the worst food I've ever eaten. I will be surprised if I'm not sick in the middle of the night. i would rather have food poising than to order from here again. sorry for the blatant honesty but i'm trying to save people.The food is very good but, the customer service sucks!  I have been on hold (just to ask a question 20 minutes & I hung up).  I tried to place an order on UberEats & it was cancelled!  I'm soo done with this place!
